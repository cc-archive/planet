<p>Kudos to <a href="http://www.pix-yu.com/" title="Pix-Yu">Pix-Yu</a> for creating an engaging social networking site where users can easily share photo events. Pix-Yu supports Creative Commons licensing and is promoted as an “online virtual space in which users can share life experiences, events, journeys, holidays and meetings etc, by uploading an unlimited number of pictures.”
</p><p><a href="http://flickr.com/" title="Flickr">Flickr</a> has been one of the most visible supporters of Creative Commons over the past few years, now displaying over <a href="http://flickr.com/creativecommons/" title="Flickr CC">54 million CC-licensed photos</a>. We’re always working to explore CC integration with both new and existing sites and services. While Flickr has just passed the <a href="http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/11/flickr-two-bill.html" title="Flickr passes 2 billion photos">2 billion photo mark</a>, Facebook claims to hold twice as many. It’d be fantastic to see important photo-sharing sites like <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" title="Picasa">Picasa</a>,  <a href="http://photobucket.com/" title="Photobucket">Photobucket</a>, and others incorporate CC licensing. Together we can work towards a critical mass of open photography. Pix-Yu is a great example of a start-up networking site that is supporting user creativity by enabling open content sharing from the get-go.
</p><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/contact/" title="Contact Page">Holler at us</a> if you have a project we can help you integrate with CC licensing.

<p><a href="http://www.propellerheads.se/">Propellerhead Software</a>, makers of electronic-music production tool Reason, have recently re-released their <a href="http://www.propellerheads.se/remote.cfm?sID=dynamo&amp;nav=yes&amp;menu=/products/education/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_menu&amp;page=/products/education/index.cfm?fuseaction=get_article&amp;article=tmwr_download">“Teaching Music With Reason”</a> lesson set under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/se/deed.en_US">BY-NC license</a>. Originally intended for educators teaching courses on electronic music at the high school and college level, “Teaching” was made for Reason 2.5 and provided, among other things, lessons, source material, and student booklets. 
</p><p>As Reason is now at version 4, the book does have some inconsistencies with the program’s current UI. While this traditionally would be a hindrance, by re-releasing “Teaching” under a CC license, Propellherhead have created a document that can grow and change with the help of the Reason community, adding new value to an old tool. Motivated users of the program can augment the lesson plans, updating and adding information as they see fit. Similarly, if users simply wish to get a hold on some basic information for free, they can use the material and “massage” it to make sense for Reason 4.</p></div>

</p><p>The University of Texas maintains a useful <a href="http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu/">“Copyright Crash Course”</a> through its library website. It’s a great resource, providing a clearinghouse of information on many topics such as ownership and management of copyrights, open access materials, fair use and orphan works, and copyright issues within libraries and universities. Of course, the site lays out the ways Creative Commons can help us build on others’ creative expression (and is itself licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">BY-NC-SA</a>). A note from the authors on the ease of CC:
</p><blockquote><p>“I only had to copy and paste a snippet of code I got from the Creative Commons Website into this document to make the license appear. The snippet does three things: it creates this cool little image, it links the reader directly to the Creative Commons site for more details about my license and it makes this document searchable by the Creative Commons search engines so that people who are looking for materials they can be sure they are free to use can easily find it. Very powerful stuff.”</p></blockquote></div>

<p><a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/">Indaba Music</a>, “an international community of musicians, music professionals, and fans exploring the creative possibilities of making music with people in different places”, has recently <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/blogs/show/news/836-session-file-licensing">added the ability to CC-license tracks to its user interface</a>.
</p><p>This is great news, especially for a community that is firmly based around of the concept of new and interesting forms of collaboration. Incorporating CC-licenses on work posted to Indaba helps bring clarity to the community in terms of what can be shared and reused and what can’t. Now, artists and musicians can clearly dictate which works they wish others to build upon, and similarly, see which works allow themselves to be reused. Up until this point, Indaba’s community has certainly embodied the ethos behind CC-licenses - that of a flexible and user-defined approach to content creation. Now, it is able to do so more explicitly.</p></div>

<p>In continuing our Featured Commoner series, we caught up with Alessandro Simonetto, founder of <a href="http://onclassical.com">OnClassical</a>, an audio label for classical music that uses CC licensing integrally in its business plan.
</p><p><img src="http://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/ale_b_hammers_half-half_500.jpg" width="500" />
</p><p><strong>What’s OnClassical all about? </strong>
</p><p>OnClassical is an online label for refined music. The name means both ON(line)CLASSICAL(music) and ON[about]CLASSICAL[music]. I define “classical” in the same way that <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/classical">Wiktionary does</a>, “of or relating to the first class, especially in literature or art” or, “that which designates a kind and forms a base.”. Of course we concern ourselves only with music, not with the other arts. Our aim is to publish music that is deeply rooted in the culture of music at its truest level, including music that is innovative or the fruit of improvisation.
</p><p>The philosophy of OnClassical brings together not only quality compositions and performances, but also quality recordings that we either produce ourselves or carefully select from the submissions we receive. We recently chose to define onclassical.com as the “online label for audiophiles,” in large part due to a review by premier piano manufacturer Boesendorfer, in which a recording of ours was defined as “very excellent” (<a href="http://www.onclassical.com/texts/press/07-03_boesendorfer_appreciation_to_alessandro_simonetto.pdf">PDF available here</a>).
</p><p>The label proposes “a new way to think about music.” This means music with no packaging that is distributed via the Internet. OnClassical shares profits 50/50 with artists, and requests no fees or exclusive agreements to join. Besides this, the level of quality in its published performances and recordings is very high and for this reason it is not easy to become one of OnClassical’s featured artists.

<p><a href="http://iheartcomix.com/">IHEARTCOMIX</a>, a record label and events promotion group based out of LA, have recently added CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/">BY-NC</a> licenses to their remix contests for both <a href="http://iheartcomix.com/blog/franki/heartsrevolution-remix-contest-playing-still-fucking-aweosme-monday-11-12">HEARTSREVOLUTION’s “C.Y.O.A”</a> and <a href="http://iheartcomix.com/blog/ocelot/ocelot-remix-contest">Ocelot’s “Lo Sforzo”</a>. Both songs are seriously cool and the winning remixes will land up sharing respective vinyl space with their source tracks.
</p><p>It is great to see this type of license adoption from a label like IHEARTCOMIX, who exist in a musical environment where remixes can be as important (and sometimes more) in popularizing the original track. Unofficial remixes have become an essential part of the musical climate IHEARTCOMIX inhabits, and as bedroom producers and their remixes continue to rise in popularity and number, having the kind of fluidity allowed by CC licenses means these remixes are able to exist in a legally sound environment, without impacting  commercial concerns. That IHEARTCOMIX is adding promotional opportunity (via shared space on vinyl) for this kind of reuse affirms its importance.

<p>Just a quick note to let everyone know that tomorrow's <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/lawreport/">Law Report</a> on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/">ABC Radio National</a> will focus on Creative Commons.</p>
<p>The show, which airs at 8:30am AEST, will feature excerpts from a debate held at this year's Melbourne Writer's Festival, <a href="http://www.mwf.com.au/2007/content/events.asp?name=20070826_1130_350WS">Creative Commons or Creative Theft?</a>, in which CC-using sci fi author <a href="http://craphound.com/bio.php">Cory Doctorow</a> and CCau's own Jessica Coates duked it out with <a href="http://www.mwf.com.au/2007/content/standard.asp?name=FisherJ">Jeremy Fisher</a> (the Director of the Australian Society of Authors) and <a href="http://www.mwf.com.au/2007/content/standard.asp?name=GrantS">Sandy Grant</a> (Publisher and Director of the Copyright Agency Limited) about the role of open content licensing in modern publishing.</p>
<p>The debate was lots of fun and had some great speeches, so we definitely encourage people to catch the show tomorrow.</p>
<p>The show will also feature an interview with Jessica on Creative Commons, what it is and how it's being implemented in Australia today.</p>
<p>The Radio National online stream is available <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/listen/default.htm">here</a>.

</tbody></table><a href="http://www.ip.qut.edu.au/">Intellectual Property: Knowledge, Culture and Economy</a> (IP:KCE) researchers Jessica Coates, Nic Suzor and Dr Anne Fitzgerald have prepared a report for the QLD Government entitled, ‘Legal Aspects of Web 2.0 Activities: Management of Legal Risk Associated with Use of YouTube, MySpace and Second Life’.<p></p>
<p>As Web 2.0 technologies proliferate, an increasing number of Australians, especially young Australians, are relying primarily on information and communication technologies to engage and interact with each other and the world. If governments are to have meaningful interaction with young people, it is therefore important for them to explore the potential of these communication platforms. But legal considerations must be taken into account when strategising how best to make use of emerging technologies.</p>
<p>The report identifies the practical legal risks associated with activities conducted in online participatory spaces. Encompassing Copyright, Privacy, Defamation, Breach of Confidence and other areas of law, the report outlines the main considerations that arise when engaging in the online environment. It also examines the popular social networking platforms YouTube, MySpace and Second Life in detail, analysing legal issues specific to their Terms of Use and functionality.</p>

<p>CCau is glad to (slightly belatedly) welcome New Zealand to the Creative Commons fold. </p>
<p>On 27 October <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.nz">Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</a> launched its licences. Headed up by Dr Brian Opie, and operating under the auspices of <a href="http://www.humanities.org.nz/">Te Whāinga Aronui The Council for the Humanities</a>, the launch of CCANZ was one of the principal goals of the New Zealand Government's National Digital Content Strategy.</p>
<p>The launch took place at the National Library in Wellington. CCau was represented  by Dr Anne Fitzgerald, who gave a presentation on the current state of CC internationally. </p>
<p>CCANZ has launched with the CC v3.0 licence - now it's up to us here in Australia to update our own licences to keep up with our cross-Tasman counsins.</p></div>

<p>The digital environment presents new opportunities for musicians and new business models for the distribution of music. Creative Commons licensing in particular has gained considerable favour with content producers world-wide. However the legalities and practicalities of releasing music under these new models can be complicated, particularly when you wish to combine them with more traditional collective licensing options (for further information visit <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.au/musicinfo">www.creativecommons.org.au/musicinfo</a>).</p>

Artabase is a beta social networking site for the arts community, turning contemporary events listings into a growing database of art history.</p>
<p>"Images on Artabase can now offer a Creative Commons license if the artist want so that people can reproduce the images on other websites, etc, with some conditions attached," Artabase Director, Rebecca Cannon, says, "which is great if you want to increase your exposure, for example, by allowing other blogs to show off your work." She also throws a salute out to Creative Commons "for making sharing legal."</p>
<p>The site allows users to upload individual images and past, present and future exhibitions (which link groups of images together into a collection) for free. As exhibitions pass, they are archived to keep a dynamic history of the Australian visual arts sector. It also includes gallery pages.</p>
<p>Where a Creative Commons licence has been placed on the image, the name of the licence (including a link to the Commons Deed) replaces "All Rights Reserved" in the copyright notice. If you're an artist, simply <a href="http://artabase.net/sign_up">sign up</a> and start posting your work.</p>
<p>Artabase is in Beta stage, with <a href="http://ccelliott.blogspot.com/2007/10/australian-arts-website-includes-cc.html">more</a> streamlining of the CC process to come.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aduki.net.au">Aduki Independent Press</a>, a boutique publishing company based in Melbourne, has today announced the publication of a new book - <a href="http://www.aduki.net.au/images/stories/books/stiymh%20info%20sheet.pdf">Stick this in your memory hole</a> by Tristan Clark. This collection of 37 essays uses satire, insight and the occasional foul language to critique the state of politics and society in contemporary Australia. </p>
<p>Why is this important to CCau? Because the book, in its entirety, is being made available under a CC Attribution-Noncommercial licence. </p>
<p>As far as we are aware, this is the first case of a book being released independently by an Australian publisher under a CC licence. Sure, we've published a few books ourselves (including the excellent <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/ocl">Open Content Licensing: Cultivating the Creative Commons</a>), and rumour has it there are some self-publishing efforts. But Aduki seems to be the first independent publisher in Australia to get behind its author's wish to truly share their book with the nation using CC.</p>
<p>Breaking out from the pack and taking the plunge into open content licensing isn't an easy decision for a small publisher to make, and Aduki deserves to be congratulated. But, as they say in their <a href="http://www.aduki.net.au/images/stories/books/stiymh%20info%20sheet.pdf">press release</a>, with its strong message in support of free speech 'Stick this in your memory hole' is the perfect book to begin with. </p>
<p>As Emily Clark of Aduki press puts it "We really liked the idea of giving people easy access and the right to use the work without seeking our permission as the book has an important message that needs to be shared."</p></div>

<p>CCau is pleased to pass on the announcement from the head office in San Francisco that Creative Commons officially has a new Vice President and General Counsel - Virginia Rutledge. </p>
<p>As you can see from the press release <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7692">here</a>, Creative Commons would have been hard pressed to find a more qualified candidate. She has worked as a litigation associate in the areas of intellectual property, art, entertainment, antitrust, securities, and general commercial law for the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore LLP. She is also published art historian, who has presented on art, digital media, and intellectual property law at conferences around the world.</p>
<p>For those who remember, CC's former General Counsel was Australian Mia Garlick, who left for new challenges on Google's legal team back in May. Since Mia left there's been a gapping hole in the CC community. It's great to have Virginia to fill the void.</p>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>Well, today is my last day.  I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time here at CC.  Thanks to everyone here at the office and elsewhere who I interacted with this summer.  I’ve met a lot of innovative, hardworking folks and they all deserve a big kudos.  While I’ve been here I’ve created liblicense which had been conceived for a while by Jon.  I think its at a point where inclusion into content platforms is now the key.  We’ve done three releases but technically four.  None of this would have been possible without the help of Jason Kivlighn.  Back at the University of Washington (UW) him and I were roommates and will be living in the same house this fall.  Jason is a super coder who finished his own Google Summer of Code project about halfway through the summer.  Instead of just fizzling out he helped me by revamping parts of liblicense and writing modules to support all of the formats we currently support.  I wouldn’t have gotten nearly as far without Jason’s help.  Before I bid farewell and move on, let me recap a bit of what I did.</p>
<p>Well, my primary project was liblicense.  Basically,  I was handed down the idea of tracking licenses on ‘the desktop’.  I arrived to find tons of UI mockups created by Rebecca for my implementing pleasure. Before I began implementing the UIs I spent the first three or four weeks conceptualizing and implementing the core liblicense library.  The first (and second) release was on July 13.  After this release I began focusing on Gnome desktop integration.  I really enjoyed seeing a frontend to the hardwork I did on the backend.  Hopefully, more will be done.  At the same time as I did the Gnome integration, Jason mirrored my efforts in KDE4.  After the release of the gnome stuff and library changes on July 30, I moved onto Sugar integration.  I’ve since finished the Sugar integration and the files are available here: http://cctools.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cctools/liblicense-sugar/trunk/ .  We’ll probably never officially release it due to its exclusivity to the Sugar interface.  I’m proud of where liblicense has come.  Like I’ve written before, I think that license awareness is important and liblicense is a small, important step in the right direction.</p>
<p>My other project which I volunteered to help with was the LiveContent liveCD.  When I got here Tim was assigned the task of producing the new Creative Commons LiveCD with a target of LinuxWorld (August 8th) as a release date.  After a week or so here I offered to technically advise the project.  While my intention was to only be a reference I quickly became technically responsible for the CD and its creation.  Although this was not what I had bargained for, it was well worth it.  To create the CD we utilized livecd-creator, a Fedora LiveCD creator.  It was a challenge for me to adapt to a different packaging system (from portage for Gentoo to rpm for Fedora).  Additionally, although livecd-creator is a step in the right direction (like liblicense) it did not fulfill all of  our needs and resulted in some hacky scripts to build the CD.  To counter those frustrations I added an easter egg to the CD which I will not disclose.  <img src="http://techblog.creativecommons.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" class="wp-smiley" />  Having Tim orchestrating the entire project also reduced my stress level quite a bit.  However, it is quite nerve-racking creating a LiveCD to be duplicated 1000 times and pushed by both Creative Commons and Fedora.  All in all, it turned out great.  The next version(s), which I will not be a part of,  should be even better.</p>
<p>I’m moving on.  While I’ve enjoyed my time here at CC, I’ll not be continuing on these projects.  I’ve got a somewhat short attention span for projects and it has run dry for both LiveContent and liblicense.  Over the last few days I’ve been brain dumping so that Asheesh can pick up where I left off.  This move should be good for the projects because Asheesh is a very smart and driven person.  You should check out his current project jsWidget. Since I’m done,  I’ll be driving home to Washington (the state not the district) tomorrow morning.  When I get there I’ll be enjoying home and working on educational materials for teaching Python in the intro Computer Science course at UW.  After that I plan on focusing on my own projects.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’d like to thank everyone here at CC.  Alex, our graphic designer, has been a huge help on both liblicense (he wrote the Ruby bindings) and LiveContent ( he did the sweet packaging).  Nathan Yergler’s flexibility allowed me to switch between projects on my own will and thus keep stress to a minimum.  All of the other CC interns, Tim, Rebecca, Cameron and Thierry, made this summer great because we bonded as a group as we worked hard and hung out at various events.  Finally, Jon has been an immense help by entertaining my questions, dealing with my grumpiness and encouraging me on both of my projects.  As always, there are many others who made this a great experience but the folks mentioned are those who I worked with day-to-day.  Thanks, everyone.  I hope that what I started while here at CC sees much use in the future.  Cheers.</p></div>

<p>The tech team here is examining how we can better-organize our web servers and web sites.  If you are a DNS sleuth, you may have noticed that most of our web sites are served from a server called “apps.creativecommons.org.” But there are some problems with this setup: for example, some of our sites are lots of little static files (like the images site, i.creativecommons.org), and some serve CPU-intensive web pages (like wiki.creativecommons.org).  We can handle many, many more requests to i.creativecommons.org per second than to wiki.creativecommons.org.</p>
<p>In order to prevent Apache from overloading the computer it’s running on, we have to limit the maximum number of web pages it can serve at once.  If a thousand people at once were requesting our images, that would be no problem, but we couldn’t really handle a thousand requests to our wiki at once.  So we have to set the web server to the limit that can be handled by the most difficult site – otherwise, when more people start editing our wiki at once than we can handle, service will degrade really terribly for everyone, even the clients just getting images from i.creativecommons.org!</p>
<p>We knew the above from experience, but we didn’t really have data on which web sites (“vhosts”) were using up the most server resources. At first I thought I’d turn to Apache’s powerful logging system. I wanted to know how much server time was elapsing between the start of a request and when the server was ready to respond to it. Alas, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</a> only lets you log the total time elapsed from start of request to end of request, which means that large files or users on slow links can distort the picture. A large image file going slowly to a modem user doesn’t actually preclude us from sending another few hundred such files at the same time. On the other hand, if a wiki page is taking 5 seconds before it is ready to be sent to the user, those 5 seconds will be even longer if someone else requests another wiki page. Measuring the time from start of request to the beginning of the response seemed a good (albeit rough) way to measure actual server-side resources needed to respond.</p>
<p>I did notice that <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_headers.html">mod_headers</a> could send a message to the client telling him exactly what I wanted to record! So I patched Apache to have mod_headers pass its information down to mod_log_config, and then I could log how much time elapsed from request start to</p>
<p>Every once in a while, but as recently as this past weekend (at <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.org/SuperHappyDevHouse19">Super Happy Dev House</a>, even!), I hear people say, “Open source is great, but it’s not as if anyone actually uses the source to fix problems they encounter.” In this case, software freedom was more than theoretical; it meant the ability to make the software tell us things about itself that helps us better serve the community we exist to serve.</p>
<p>You all can see (and distribute under the same terms as Apache) the <a href="http://cctools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cctools/log_analysis/vhost_effort/">patch and some quick reporting scripts</a> I slapped together.  Feel free to email me with any questions!</p></div>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>A few days ago we released version 0.3 of liblicense.  This version focused on bringing liblicense onto the desktop and improvements to make that a satisfying experience.  The primary things we added to integrate into Gnome were a generic GTK license chooser widget, default license chooser, and nautilus extension.  These things combine to demonstrate the power of licensing on the desktop.  Additionally, we added optional sqlite3 cache support to speed up the <strong>get_licenses</strong>() function primarily.  Here is a run through of the changes.</p>
<p>The GTK license widget is used extensively throughout the integration.  The widget provides an interface to the license choosing functions in liblicense.  A user selects a license by toggling various attributes.</p>
<p><img src="http://cc-livecd.dreamhosters.com/ll_default_1.png" align="middle" height="467" alt="GTK Widget in Default Chooser" width="321" /></p>
<p>This is the default license chooser.  The GTK widget is in the frame above the buttons.  The widget provides <strong>get_license</strong> and <strong>set_license</strong> which in this case is used to set the default license for the system.  Ideally, the default system license would be used by applications when they embed license data upon save.  However, that is ideal and not implemented yet.</p>
<p>The default license is used in the nautilus extension.  The default license is used in the file properties license tab whenever a file doesn’t have a license set.  The properties tab also utilizes the GTK widget.   Once the user selects a license for the file(s) and closes the dialog the data is written to the files using the liblicense io modules.  These are C modules which embed and extract license data in particular file formats.  Having numerous modules provides decent coverage of file formats.  Currently, if Exempi support is enabled, all files can be handled by creating an XMP sidecar file in the absence of any other means of license storage.  We’ve also considered other means of license association but see embedding as the ideal option.  Here is a screenshot from nautilus.</p>
<p><img src="http://cc-livecd.dreamhosters.com/ll_nautilus_scaled.png" alt="Nautilus File Properties" /></p>
<p>The second aspect of the nautilus integration is license loading upon folder open and resulting emblems.  All the extension does is reads the license from every file nautilus loads and tags Creative Common’s licensed files with the CC logo and non-CC licensed works with our license icon.  Here is  a screenshot of the emblems.</p>
<p><img src="http://cc-livecd.dreamhosters.com/ll_nautilus_emblem_scaled.png" alt="Nautilus CC emblems" /></p>
<p>Thats about it.  We’d love feedback before our next release (0.4).  On the CC wiki we have a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Liblicense_04_release_todo" title="0.4 release to do">running list of things to do</a>.  You can get liblicense 0.3 from the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80503&amp;package_id=238700" title="liblicense download">cctools download page</a>  The liblicense home is also on the CC wiki available <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/project/Liblicense" title="liblicense project page">here</a>.  Its currently available in source packages, rpms and ebuilds and will be available in debs by the end of today.

<p>The scrubbing bubbles have been at work again on JsWidget. JsWidget is an attempt to let web application developers insert the Creative Commons “Choose a license” questions into their application by just including one file from creativecommons.org.</p>
<p>I just released a new pre-release version of JsWidget, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=529136&amp;group_id=80503">version 0.3</a>. You can read about the project on <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/JsWidget">its wiki page</a>, including learning how to use it.  There are some interesting new features:</p>
<p>First of all, it’s compatible with Internet Explorer. My generated JavaScript code was suffering from a correctness issue that using XHTML in Firefox showed me, and fixing that made it render in Internet Explorer.  (Then I had to <a href="http://nathan.ashleafmedia.com/2007/onclick-not-onchange/">switch</a> from using onChange to onClick, again a subtle correctness issue.)</p>
<p>Secondly, it supports a cool form of internationalization called HTTP Content Negotiation. Web browsers optionally (but usually) send a header to the web server indicating the sort of content they can accept, including what languages the user wants to read. In addition to the old ?locale= form of specifying a language, the text should be translated to the user’s native language. (Unfortunately not all of the strings are translated yet, but try hovering over an info box or looking through the list of jurisdictions. In all cases where we don’t have a translation, we fall back to US English.)</p>
<p>Finally, it supports a feature called “license seeding.” By default, the UI offers the user the Attribution license in the generic jurisdiction. By passing in a URL, you can change that starting point. This is especially useful for letting a user revisit a license choice he made in the past and consider changing it.</p>
<p>You can read more about these features on the wiki page for this project, and if you’re sly you could even look at your plan for the future. But the most fun thing to do always is to play with our demos!  Now there are three:<br />

<p>I’ve been working for the past week or so on a JavaScript licensing widget that has been <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/JsWidget">suggested on our wiki</a>.  It’s a new way to integrate CC licensing into your web application.  It’s really as easy as pie: Just add the following tag somewhere in the body:<br />
</p><blockquote>&lt;script src=”http://api.creativecommons.org/jswidget/tags/0.1/complete.js” /&gt;</blockquote><br />
and a CC licensing widget will appear.  Your web application can then use<br />
regular DOM queries to determine the user’s choice.<p></p>
<p>NOTE that this is not ready for prime-time use!  I want feedback on what people would like us to add or change.  Right now it serves only English-language text; in the future you will be able to add ?locale=, stick your language code at the end, and get text back in your language.  Beyond translation, tell me how else I can be of service!</p>
<p>You can download a trivial sample application and a long-ish README at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80503&amp;package_id=239510">our SourceForge project</a>.  For y’all’s convenience here’s a <a href="https://cctools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cctools/jswidget/tags/0.1/example_web_app/README">link to the README</a>.</p>
<p>It’ll take you all of five minutes to deeply understand what’s going on, so I suggest you do if you’re thinking about (or if you already are) offering CC licensing to users of web applications you work on.</p>
