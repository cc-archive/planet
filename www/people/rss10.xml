	<title>Lawrence Lessig: 9 days till we're 5</title>

By Tama Lever at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/tamaleaver/2046561465/&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;,

Tama's is the latest winning Flickr photo in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.creativecommons.org/contest&quot;&gt;CC Flickr contest&lt;/a&gt;. It nicely captures my obsessive focus these next 9 days. 

We turn 5 on the 15th. We've got a long way to got to meet our target for the year. Ordinarily we'd have till the end  of the year. But this year, I want to meet the target by December 15. We've all been working insanely hard to pull this (and a list of amazing announcements) together. I want to be able to let the staff go back to life on December 16. And I want to have sometime to explain to my 4 year old just how reindeer fly. 

So please, if you haven't, &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.creativecommons.org&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; us now. If you have, &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.creativecommons.org&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; us again. If you've got any really good dirt on someone, blackmail them now. And, as a special (if corrupt) bonus: If you donate $100 or more, I'll send a free DVD of my first &lt;a href=&quot;http://lessig.org/blog/2007/10/corruption_lecture_alpha_versi_1.html&quot;&gt;corruption lecture&lt;/a&gt;. Just send an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:corrupt_lessig@pobox.com&quot;&gt;corrupt_lessig@pobox.com&lt;/a&gt; after you make your donation with an address, and off it will go.</content:encoded>

	<title>Lawrence Lessig: the iCommons Auction</title>
	<link>http://lessig.org/blog/2007/12/the_icommons_auction_1.html</link>

&lt;a href=&quot;http://iCommons.org&quot;&gt;iCommons&lt;/a&gt; is the group CC incubated and then have begun to spin out this year. Its aim is to build a common (but not CC owned) platform for digital freedom related issues (A2K, free software, open source software, free culture, free knowledge, activism, etc.). Its main annual event is a conference. The first year was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icommons.org/isummit05/&quot;&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;. The second, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icommons.org/isummit06/&quot;&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icommons.org/isummit07/&quot;&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;. Next year &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icommons.org/isummit08/&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;.

iCommons is having an &lt;a href=&quot;http://icommons.org/auction&quot;&gt;auction&lt;/a&gt; to build support (and $$!, or actually €) for iCommons. Among the items auctioned is the (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;amp;item=360003000531&quot;&gt;embarrassingly worn) black jacket I have worn&lt;/a&gt; while traveling about 500,000 miles over the last few years. Weird (but clean). Bid away!</content:encoded>

	<title>Elliott Bledsoe: mayer + bettle: the sequel?!</title>
	<link>http://ccelliott.blogspot.com/2007/12/mayer-bettle-sequel.html</link>
	<content:encoded>There's word on the street is that the loveable CC duo Mayer and Bettle featured in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org.au/animation_train&quot;&gt;CCau animation film&lt;/a&gt; are planning to hit the set on a new sequel to the much loved, much distributed film. Almost three years on and the pair feel it is time to update their message. The duo aren't saying much at this early stage, but Mayer did say, &quot;It's more of what you loved, but this time we're talking creator's rights.&quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;Much has changed since we shot the first film,&quot; Mayer said, &quot;Which is why Bettle and I are getting back in front of the Camera.&quot; Tightening of the licences, expanded metadata, a dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;http://learn.creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;education division&lt;/a&gt; and exploration into &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus&quot;&gt;complimentary licensing options&lt;/a&gt; are just some of the key developments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bettle, who is still riding high on the success of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot; class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;The Best Song in the World&lt;/span&gt;, has been spending much of her time exploring different ways of using CC. &quot;With this new animation we want to help you, the creators out there, to understand the great potential of CC,&quot; she told CCau staff this morning. &quot;Give some, take some. That's what it's all about,&quot; she said, &quot;If you're taking from the commons, and you want to put it back, this new film will show you how.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first animation film, which has been republished 1000s of times, translated and subtitled and &lt;a href=&quot;http://revver.com/&quot;&gt;Revver&lt;/a&gt;ised to help fundraise for CC internationally, was a huge success.  Mayer and Bettle are enthusiastically joined by the original film team, CCau staffer &lt;a href=&quot;http://ccelliott.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Elliott Bledsoe&lt;/a&gt;, animator &lt;a href=&quot;http://iusebiro.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Pete Foley&lt;/a&gt;, musician Chris Perren and actors Dash Kruck and Mem Rynne in the production of the sequel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;the text of creative commons through the looking glass is available for reuse under the terms of a creative commons attribution 2.5 australia license. for more information see 'legals + licence' at http://ccelliott.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

America is having a &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7855&quot;&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco that will include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...announcements by Joi Ito and Lawrence Lessig, a live acoustic performance by Gilberto Gil, video remixing by Phi Phenomenon, and music provided by DJ Spooky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're over there, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/8/8c/Flier-general-final.pdf&quot;&gt;get along&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here in Australia, we're hosting a party for CC at my house!! We're leveraging our time zone advantage to kick off the 5th birthday celebrations for Creative Commons. And how? We're having a true blue Aussie breakfast BBQ (and some champagne too!) on Saturday December 15. So unless the newbies over at CC New Zealand host a midnight party we're the first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come along any time after 10am. We'll provide some BBQ treats, but bring some of your own. Email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jessica@creativecommons.org.au&quot;&gt;Jessica Coates&lt;/a&gt; for more details if you wanna come!&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;the text of creative commons through the looking glass is available for reuse under the terms of a creative commons attribution 2.5 australia license. for more information see 'legals + licence' at http://ccelliott.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Carolina Botero: Wikipedia: GFDL y CCBYSA ¡Compatibles!</title>
	<link>http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/?p=299</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://barrapunto.com/article.pl?sid=07/12/02/028227&amp;amp;from=rss&quot;&gt;Barrapunto&lt;/a&gt; trae el recuento de lo que Lessig anuncia en &lt;a href=&quot;http://lessig.org/blog/2007/12/some_important_news_from_wikip.html&quot;&gt;su blog&lt;/a&gt; y que desde la &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update&quot;&gt;Fundación Wikimedia explican&lt;/a&gt;: FSF ha acordado hacer los ajustes necesarios a la GFDL que permita hacer compatible esta licencia con la de Creative Commons AtribuciónCompartiIgual. Cuando esto se verifique será la comunidad de wikipedia la que deberá pronunciarse para que Wikipedia “&lt;strong&gt;relicencie&lt;/strong&gt;” con CCBYSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El tema ha tenido un importante eco en la &lt;a href=&quot;http://planet.creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;blogosfera de gente relacionada con Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;, pero seguramente lo más interesante va a ser la discusión sobre el proceso de migración que se inicie en la comunidad de Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primer gran paso el que se hace en compatibilidad y un gran cambio si wikipedia relicencia, no? (gracias &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.eljeffto.com/&quot;&gt;Jeffrey&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Joi Ito: Wikipedia and Creative Commons move closer</title>
	<link>http://joi.ito.com/archives/2007/12/02/wikipedia_and_creative_commons_move_closer.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;personquote&quot;&gt;Lessig Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lessig.org/blog/2007/12/some_important_news_from_wikip.html&quot;&gt;Some important news from Wikipedia to understand clearly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you’ll see in this video, there has been important progress in making Wikipedia compatible with the world of &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; licensed work. But we should be very precise about this extremely good news: As Jimmy announces, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Foundation Board&lt;/a&gt; has agreed with a proposal made by the Free Software Foundation that will permit Wikipedia (and other such wikis) to relicense under a &lt;a href=&quot;http://http//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is very different from saying that Wikipedia has relicensed under a CC license. The decision whether to take advantage of this freedom granted by the FSF when the FSF grants it will be a decision the Wikipedia community will have to make. We are very hopeful that the community will ratify this move to compatible freedoms. And if they do, we are looking forward to an extraordinary celebration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the Wikimedia Foundation resolution &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My endless thanks to everyone who has helped make this possible, from Richard Stallman and the FSF board, to the important leaders within the Wikipedia community who say yet another legal obstacle to freedom that they could remove. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thanks to everyone who has been working on it. This is a very significant step in improving interoperability and I think this is a great example of how we can all work together to benefit the free culture community. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

	<title>Mike Linksvayer: Steps toward better software and content</title>
	<link>http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/12/01/copyleft-pd/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Wikimedia Foundation board has passed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update&quot;&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; that is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7876&quot;&gt;step toward Wikipedia migrating to the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license&lt;/a&gt;. I have an uninteresting interest in this due to working at Creative Commons (I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; represent them on this blog), but as someone who wants to see free knowledge “win” and achieve &lt;a href=&quot;http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2006/12/10/peer-production-revolution/&quot;&gt;revolutionary&lt;/a&gt; impact, I declare this an important step forward. The current fragmentation of the universe of free content along the lines of legally incompatible but similar in spirit &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;copyleft&lt;/a&gt; licenses delays and endangers the point at which that universe reaches critical mass — when any given project decides to use a copyleft license merely because then being able to include content from the free copyleft universe makes that decision make sense. This has worked fairly well in the software world with the GPL as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; copyleft license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyleft was and is a great hack, and useful in many cases. But practically it is a major barrier to collaboration in some contexts and politically it is still based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/09/10/copyright-intervention/&quot;&gt;censorship&lt;/a&gt;. So I’m always extremely pleased by any expansion of the public domain. There could hardly be a more welcome expansion than &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_J._Bernstein&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;Daniel J. Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://lwn.net/Articles/260481/&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; of his code (most notably &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qmail&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;qmail&lt;/a&gt;) into the public domain. Most of the practical benefit (including his code in free software distributions) could have been achieved by released under any free software license, including the GPL. But politically, check out this &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3147768955127254412&amp;amp;q=%22Bernstein+releases+code+to+public+domain%22&amp;amp;total=1&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;num=10&amp;amp;so=0&amp;amp;type=search&amp;amp;plindex=0&quot;&gt;two minute video&lt;/a&gt; of Bernstein pointing out some of the problems of copyright and announcing that his code is in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein (usually referred to as ‘djb’) also recently doubled the reward for finding a security hole in qmail to US$1,000. I highly recommend his &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cr.yp.to/qmail/qmailsec-20071101.pdf&quot;&gt;Some thoughts on security after ten years of qmail 1.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, also available as something approximating &lt;a href=&quot;http://cr.yp.to/talks/2007.11.02/slides.pdf&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; (also see an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eros-os.org/pipermail/cap-talk/2007-November/thread.html#9202&quot;&gt;discussion of the paper on cap-talk&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Lawrence Lessig: Some important news from Wikipedia to understand clearly</title>
	<link>http://lessig.org/blog/2007/12/some_important_news_from_wikip.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

As you'll  see in this video, there has been important progress in making Wikipedia compatible with the world of &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; licensed work. But we should be very precise about this extremely good news: As Jimmy announces, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Foundation Board&lt;/a&gt; has agreed with a proposal made by the Free Software Foundation that will permit Wikipedia (and other such wikis) to relicense under a &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license&lt;/a&gt;. 

That is very different from saying that Wikipedia has relicensed under a CC license. The decision whether to take advantage of this freedom granted by the FSF when the FSF grants it will be a decision the Wikipedia community will have to make. We are very hopeful that the community will ratify this move to compatible freedoms. And if they do, we are looking forward to an extraordinary celebration.

Read the Wikimedia Foundation resolution &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 

My endless thanks to everyone who has helped make this possible, from Richard Stallman and the FSF board, to the important leaders within the Wikipedia community who say yet another legal obstacle to freedom that they could remove.</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;A finales del 2006 y principios del 2007 participé en una investigación en torno al tema de Negocios Abiertos (aún inedita) que presentamos en &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/?p=237&quot;&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; por que fue &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/?p=238&quot;&gt;coordinada desde la Fundación Getulio Vargas&lt;/a&gt;, financiada por el &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idrc.ca/es/ev-8513-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html&quot;&gt;IDRC &lt;/a&gt;y dirigida en Colombia  por &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyu.edu/fas/faculty/cgi/gsas_local/dept/music/Ochoa.html&quot;&gt;Ana María Ochoa&lt;/a&gt;.

It was designed to explore possible options for harmonising the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apra.com.au/&quot;&gt;APRA&lt;/a&gt; and CC licensing models so Australia musicians can non-commercially CC licence while still collecting royalites from APRA for commercial use of their work. In summary the position at the moment is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In Australia (and New Zealand) the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), like many collecting societies around the world, takes a full assignment of the member’s performing rights of all past, present and future works. By assigning the rights to the collecting society it allows more efficient administration of the royalty collection process. However, this raises compatibility issues for creators who have assigned their rights to a collecting society but then seek to license a work or works under a Creative Commons “Non-Commercial” licence. In simple terms, once a person is a member of APRA, the performing right in all works is assigned to APRA and therefore the creator no longer has the right to issue any direct licences for the performance of their works.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In order to make CC a (legal) option for Australian musicians in the management of their content, APRA would need to create a process by which members can elect to apply a CC licence to defined works (similar to the current &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apra.com.au/writers/downloads/OOLB_OptOutAndLicenceBack.pdf&quot;&gt;licence back options&lt;/a&gt;). There are a range of issues that need to be addressed before such an arrangement could be made. Please read the information provided on the CCau website for &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org.au/musicinfo&quot;&gt;more information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Scot Morris, International Director of APRA said himself, “APRA artists have been releasing music under Creative Commons licences&quot; and &quot;we're not going to sue our members.&quot; Equally the record lables and APRA aren't suing non-commercial users of musical works (but, as Nic Suzor notes on his &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt;, &quot;...the threat is still a significant deterrent in many cases&quot; think Dean Gray and the remixed Green Day’s American Idiot album, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Edit&quot;&gt;American Edit&lt;/a&gt;). Big deal! For the sake of those non-commercial users I want to see a more official model that provides certainty of the legality of reusing content. I want to see a trial, similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.nl/2007/08/23/cc-nl-start-pilot-flexibel-rechtenbeheer-samen-met-bumastemra/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; (if you can read Dutch) happening in the Netherlands between &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creativecommons.nl/&quot;&gt;CC Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bumastemra.nl/&quot;&gt;Buma/Stemra&lt;/a&gt;, where members are able to collect for commercial use of a work that is non-commercially licenced. The Fourm was designed to disemminate information on the situtation and to get the ball rolling on discussions of a possible trial here. As such it was great to see a lively, engaging debate emerge. That's exactly what we were looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to come out of the Forum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;APRA appear to be willing to work with CCau to find a solution to the discrepancies between the licensing models (which is good);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a need to define more clearly the term &quot;non-commerical&quot; (which has already &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.creativecommons.org/NonCommercial_Guidelines&quot;&gt;begun&lt;/a&gt; but would need to be customised to the specific situation here in Australia);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Members using CC would need to register the works that are licensed with APRA, which adds to APRA's administrative costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;APRA are concerned about who will enforce the rights of the musician where the non-commercial licence is breached.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Economics is a key factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;It is encouraging to see that APRA are (finally) willing to work with CCau to better the current situation. I conceed that to make it happen, CC may have to define in more detail what we mean by &quot;non-commerical&quot; in the licences. As Nic &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nic.suzor.com/20071128-ccau-musicforum&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;...APRA would normally collect on, for example, educational uses, whereas a musician who released their song under a CC NonCommercial licence would not be entitled to collect royalties for those classes of performance.&quot; APRA possed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/&quot;&gt;Triple J&lt;/a&gt; as another example; are they non-commercial or not? This is an area that will require some fleshing out before a trial can happen here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APRA were also concerned about who would enforce a breach of the non-commercial licence. Now fair enough if the provision that is breached is the Attribution clause, but if the Noncommercial term is breached, then it has to have been a commerical use which means it is still a matter for APRA. And APRA can act on its members' behalf. And so they should in this instance I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the economics front, APRA made the point that they would have to keep data on who of their members were using CC and on what tracks. This would be an administratively arduous task apparently. But Scot Morris detailed and showed a screen shot of APRA's software that keeps detailed statistical data on each song played by is major licensees. The information this system can hold is impressive. (In full admission of my relative naievity on the technical/software side of things) becuase CC licences include metadata, then theoretically if you modified the software to read and recognise this metadata that would automate at least some of the admin required wouldn't it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also cited diminished bargaining power as a problem. They were concerned that by letting people CC licence for non-commercial use it would allow licensees who were using these tracks to argue for discounted licensing fees. Boo hoo I say. If a muscian has decided they are ok will allowing non-commercial use they clearly that means they've conceded to not getting a royalty for that use. What really seems to be the issue is that this might highlight a few statistical problems in the APRA charging shedule, not to mention APRA might just pull in less money (again, a point picked up by Nic,&quot;[APRA's] main concern seemed to be that Murdoch and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; would be able to exploit musicians by using Creative Commons licensed music&quot;).&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;the text of creative commons through the looking glass is available for reuse under the terms of a creative commons attribution 2.5 australia license. for more information see 'legals + licence' at http://ccelliott.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

As I said when I announced the lawsuit &lt;a href=&quot;http://lessig.org/blog/2007/09/on_the_texas_suit_against_virg.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,  the fact that the laws of the United States don't make us liable for the misuse in this context doesn't mean that we're not working extremely hard to make sure misuse doesn't happen. It is always a problem (even if not a legal problem) when someone doesn't understand what our licenses do, or how they work. We need to work harder to make that clear. But the news today lets us go back to the work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;, without the burden of this lawsuit hanging above us. 

So how can you celebrate with us? Well, help us recover some of the costs (probably $15k) that we have to eat because of this suit (deductibles with our insurance company, etc) by &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.creativecommons.org&quot;&gt;supporting CC&lt;/a&gt;. Or help us by joining as just a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lessig.org/blog/2007/11/50000_friends.html&quot;&gt;friend of CC&lt;/a&gt;.  Or help us by spreading the news that the lawsuit is over.

And as one final word to the plaintiffs here -- a word I can utter because neither required nor asked: As CEO of Creative Commons, I apologize for any trouble that confusion about our licenses might have created. We thought the meaning was clear. We work hard to make this as clear as we can. We will work harder.</content:encoded>

Most of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asauthors.org/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=ASP0016/ccms.r?PageId=10041&quot;&gt;writers' centres&lt;/a&gt; are really interested so we hope to go a lot further with it soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, the idea is that remixing isn't limited to film and music. There is no reason why the written word should not be open to the possibility of creative play. Remix my lit exists to facilitate experimentation in literature remixing. The first planned project will see a body of works by established authors released into the commons for remixing. All remixes will be hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.remixmylit.com/&quot;&gt;remixmylit.com&lt;/a&gt; and a selection will (hopefully) be published in a printed volume. We aim to create a community of writers exploring new ways of writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writers that are endorsing the project include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.battersby.com.au/&quot;&gt;Lee Battersby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribepublications.com.au/author/catekennedy&quot;&gt;Cate Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allen-unwin.com/Vogel/current.asp&quot;&gt;Stefan Laszczuk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://emilymaguire.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Emily McGuire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesphelan.com.au/&quot;&gt;James Phelan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kimwilkins.com/&quot;&gt;Kim Wilkins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allenandunwin.com/default.aspx?page=311&amp;amp;author=35&quot;&gt;Danielle Wood&lt;/a&gt; as well as poet &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mandybeaumont.com/mandy/home.htm&quot;&gt;Mandy Beaumont&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to put the money where my mouth is, you can even remix my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.remixmylit.com/2007/11/26/flash-photography-and-screams/&quot;&gt;short fiction piece&lt;/a&gt;.

It will take place from 2.00 till 4.00pm on Wednesday 28 November 2007 at the Queensland College of Art, Griffith University, Brisbane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The digital environment presents new opportunities for musicians and new business models for the distribution of music. Creative Commons licensing in particular has gained considerable favour with content producers world-wide. However the legalities and practicalities of releasing music under these new models can be complicated, particularly when you wish to combine them with more traditional collective licensing options (for further information visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creativecommons.org.au/musicinfo&quot;&gt;www.creativecommons.org.au/musicinfo&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CCau Music Industry Forum aims to bring together industry representatives and interested parties to discuss issues such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• potential online distribution models for musicians and the music industry; &lt;br /&gt;• compatibility issues with current collective licensing schemes; and &lt;br /&gt;• legal and practical issues relating to the use of Creative Commons licences by Australian songwriters, composers and musicians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discussants at the Forum will include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Professor Brian Fitzgerald, Project Lead, Creative Commons Australia; &lt;br /&gt;• Scot Morris, Director International Relations, APRA; &lt;br /&gt;• Professor Paul Draper, Director of IMERSD (Intermedia, Music Education &amp;amp; Research Design) and Deputy Director, Queensland Conservatorium Research Centre, Griffith University; and&lt;br /&gt;• Q Music&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The forum also aims to gather feedback regarding the current understanding of and attitudes towards copyright, open content licensing and Creative Commons within the Australian music industry whilst providing an opportunity for key music industry personnel in to learn more about these topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creative Commons Australia is the Australian arm of the international Creative Commons project, a non-profit organisation that aims to promote flexible copyright options for creators. At the core of the Creative Commons project is a suite of licences, freely available to creators, that foster sharing and collaboration. Creative Commons builds upon the “all rights reserved” of traditional copyright to create a voluntary “some rights reserved” system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Persons  currently involved or interested in the licensing of musical works are welcome to attend. rsvp by friday 23 november 2007 to elliott at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:elliott@creativecommons.org.au&quot;&gt;elliott@creativecommons.org.au&lt;/a&gt; or call (07) 3138 9597.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org.au/ccmusicforum&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2356/1867831670_9e6b023bfe.jpg?v=0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;image: ventura mendoza, licensed under a creative commons &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;attribution licence 2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/vmendoza/490269072&quot;&gt;http://www.flickr.com/photos/vmendoza/490269072&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;the text of creative commons through the looking glass is available for reuse under the terms of a creative commons attribution 2.5 australia license. for more information see 'legals + licence' at http://ccelliott.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://ccelliott.blogspot.com/2007/11/australian-pc-world-writes-up-ccau.html</link>
	<content:encoded>Danah McConnachie at Australian PC World &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/index.php/id;1477749946&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a great article about the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org.au/ccmusicforum&quot;&gt;ccau music industry forum&lt;/a&gt;. There's a whole spiel about why we are running the forum (which is great exposure for the event) and then there is a lengthy interview with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mabula.net/tbfw/&quot;&gt;Paul Wayper&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anu.edu.au&quot;&gt;ANU&lt;/a&gt; research programmer who uses the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lmms.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;linux multimedia system&lt;/a&gt;. Wayper agrees with the CC argument that copyright is being used to lock down content:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;While Creative Commons licenses work to foster innovation and sharing or resources, traditional media companies and agencies and technologies such as DRM work against these freedoms.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other great pull-outs from the article:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;There are two fundamental changes in the landscape of music, and art, production. Firstly, it no longer takes a dedicated artist who's spent thousands on special instruments to have the equipment and talent to produce a good-quality piece of music. Secondly, the actual distribution of music no longer takes arcane mixing processes, mastering to record or CD, printing and distribution of physical items. The only thing that hasn't really changed is that people still want to listen to music,&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...I give away my pieces with a (CC) license that allows some reuse while not allowing total exploitation because I don't really expect someone to shell out money for them. If I were to turn to producing commercial trance full time I might expect to be paid, but only if I actually made something that other people were making money off. The key thing that people don't think about CC licenses is that it doesn't mean you can't negotiate the rights to other uses, just that they aren't given by default.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wayer is talking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://linux.conf.au/&quot;&gt;linux.conf.au&lt;/a&gt; 2008 in January.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;the text of creative commons through the looking glass is available for reuse under the terms of a creative commons attribution 2.5 australia license. for more information see 'legals + licence' at http://ccelliott.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Carolina Botero: FRANCIA, proponen quitarle Internet a los “piratas”.</title>
	<link>http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/?p=297</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hace solo dos años, y por casi un año, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/?p=28&quot;&gt;Francia revolucionaba la blogosfera &lt;/a&gt;con una opción concreta; la licencia global que se aprobaría a través del proyecto de ley de propiedad intelectual conocido como &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/index.php?s=dadvsi&quot;&gt;Dadvsi&lt;/a&gt;, la propuesta significaba la legalización de toda descarga de contenidos desde Internet, no se consiguió que pasara en el Congreso… pero estuvo cerca, muy cerca. Hoy sin embargo el pulso parece que lo ganan del otro lado:  bajo el liderazgo de FNAC (una de las tiendas europeas que tienen mayor participación en el mercado de venta de música y videos) se ha logrado un acuerdo entre el estado y la industria para quitar las cuentas de acceso a Internet a quienes descarguen de la red contenidos protegidos por el derecho de autor, y digo ganan por que por ahora el acuerdo ha tenido un respaldo decidido del presidente Sarkozy y parece que a pesar de las críticas saldrá adelante. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En resumen la propuesta es que se crearía una autoridad sometida a autoridad judicial para informar a quienes descarguen música y películas sobre la ilegalidad de tal acción, con el apoyo de los prestadores del servicio, las sanciones serán suspensión y cancelación del servicio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La situación por supuesto &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.audionautes.net/pages/informer/communiques/voir.php?id=43&quot;&gt;ha sido rebatida por la Asociación de Audionautas&lt;/a&gt;, tan activos en su momento apoyando la licencia global, pero sobre todo son los artículos desde Nouvelle Observateur los que me han parecido más críticos. Particularmente me han gustado: &lt;a href=&quot;http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/20071124.OBS6556/&quot;&gt;“Piratería, el informe Olivennes la considera ´peligrosa´”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/20071123.OBS6440/&quot;&gt;“Descargas, un acuerdo firmado en el Eliseo”&lt;/a&gt; y esta en la que se reproduce &lt;a href=&quot;http://clubobs.nouvelobs.com/article/2007/11/23/20071123.FAP3625.xml&quot;&gt;un artículo de Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; (les aconsejo también las reacciones que tienen algunos de los artículos).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otros artículos: en inglés &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSL2346825720071123&quot;&gt;el artículo de Reuters &lt;/a&gt;y en español acá está el de &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elpais.com/articulo/radio/television/Francia/cortara/linea/quien/baje/musica/cine/elpeputec/20071124elpepirtv_4/Tes&quot;&gt;El Pais&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Elliott Bledsoe: why it is difficult to use MC Hammer in a documentary film</title>
	<link>http://ccelliott.blogspot.com/2007/08/some-thoughts-from-cc-documentary-paper.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;font color=&quot;7CFC00&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot; size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;some thoughts from writing an article on documentary and open content licensing&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been working on an article about documentary, rights management and creative commons for far too long now. Since I spoke at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://2007.aidc.com.au&quot;&gt;Australian International Documentary Conference&lt;/a&gt;, in February actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here's a bit of precursor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rights clearances are one of the biggest hurdles for filmmakers. Copyright clearances are required for each element in the film that is not the original creation of the filmmaker. Add the amount of money that often costs, the conditions on which rights are granted by gatekeepers and the need to take content out that ins't cleared (or risk being done for copyright infringement). Oh the pangs of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permission_culture&quot;&gt;permission culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But CC presents new ways of managing copyright and alternative avenues. The Creative Commons “some rights reserved” approach offers new ways of thinking about, managing and capitalising on creative content. But these are only part of what it offers. It is also a tool for assisting collaboration, innovation and experimentation, and can open up options for utilisation, promotion and distribution of content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;7CFC00&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;copyright's “can’t touch this” effect&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The practical effect of copyright is to restrict all but a narrow set of uses  of copyrighted material or works—including “literary, dramatic, musical or artistic” works  and “subject matter other than works” such as sound recordings , films , television and sound broadcasts  and published editions of works—automatically  at the point of creation. That copyright in original works  subsists for  70 years after the end of the calendar year in which the author of the work died.  For works considered to be other subject matter the duration varies. For sound recordings and films it's 70 years after the end of the calendar year in which the work is first published.  In the case of television or sound broadcasts, copyright expires at the end of 50 years after the end of the calendar year in which the first broadcast was made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any use of a copyrighted work without the permission of the creator is an infringement of copyright attracting possible civil and criminal actions. Copyright is somewhat of a misnomer. Really it should be called copyrights given that it encompasses a bundle or rights including the right to reproduce the work, publish the work, perform it in public, communicate it to the public and to make derivative/adaptive works from it . This is why the common phrase is “All Rights Reserved” as copyright by default protects all rights in the work. Like the MC Hammer song, what this means is “can’t touch this.” These are often referred to as the economic rights of copyright. The existence of these rights independently of each facilitates copyright licensing (see below). Copyright owners also have the right  to licence to another person authority to utilise their work in relation to any or all of those rights.So long as the licensee does not exercise powers beyond the scope of the licence, they are exempt from being sued from copyright infringement. If you haven’t been granted a licence and you make an unauthorised use of the copyright you are in breach. This is symptomatic of a permissions culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;7CFC00&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;a permissions culture: copyright clearances&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The need to have approval to reuse content results in what Stanford Law Professor Lawrence Lessig calls a ‘permission culture.' [See &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.free-culture.cc/&quot;&gt;Free Culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;] It is an environment in which “creators get to create only with the permission of the powerful, or of creators from the past.” The permission culture stymies new creative endeavour; whether that is because of the complexity of getting clearance (or indeed identifying a copyright owner in order to get clearance) or the many explicit and hidden cost associated with getting copyright clearance. Possibly more concerning still is the ability of copyright holders to withhold consent to suppress negative commentary on them or affiliated organisations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are numerous examples of situations where films have been forced underground because of copyright. Take for example Peter Spears’s short &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Earnest and Bertram&lt;/span&gt;—an adaptation of Lillian Hellman’s play of unrequited gay love &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Children’s Hour&lt;/span&gt;. The film presents the Bert and Ernie characters from popular American childrens’ television program &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Seasame Street&lt;/span&gt; as closeted gay men. It was a huge success at Sundance Film Festival, but was soon off screens when owners of the characters and associated television program, Sesame Workshop issued Spears with a cease and desist notice. “I felt it was protected under First Amendment freedom of speech parody, but I understand that they have to protect their copyright,” Spears lamented in interview with the US editor of Screen International, Michael Goodridge, “When they served me the cease and desist, I didn't have the energy or financial resources to fight it.&quot;  Spears pulled the film from the festival circuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Velvet Goldmine&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Far From Heaven&lt;/span&gt;, Todd Haynes, is no stranger to the realities of rights clearances either. Even before his debut into feature, Haynes had felt the copyright pinch. His first popular short, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story&lt;/span&gt;, used Barbie dolls to retell the singers’ life. Richard Carpenter took it out of circulation for its use of original music by The Carpenters. Toy-company giant Mattel didn’t get involved despite the use of their Barbie dolls in this instance, but Argentinean filmmaker Albertina Carri wasn’t so lucky. Her film &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Barbie Can Also Be Sad&lt;/span&gt; was pulled from a film festival in Mexico after legal action taken by the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A more recent example is Robert Greenwald’s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch’s War on Journalism&lt;/span&gt;. It utilises extensive footage from the news service, leaked policy memos penned by Fox executives and interview footage with former employees to expose the ways that Fox News allegedly distorts it reporting to serve the conservative political leaning of its owner. Importantly, Greenwald used much of this content with Fox’s permission. Greenwald kept a lot of information about the project under wraps because he feared a court injunction would be sought to stop the films release. Today Fox has not responded publicly except to say in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/span&gt; “People steal our footage all the time. We generally sort of look the other way.&quot;  But of course, Fox had (and still have) the right to object to the film, and could have embroiled the film in a lengthy court battle to suppress it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Fox were not the only third party with copyright tied up in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Outfoxed&lt;/span&gt;. As &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/span&gt; outlined in an article in the lead up to the film’s release:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“…several major news organizations were unexpectedly refusing to license their clips. (Such licensing is ordinarily pro forma.) CBS wouldn't sell Greenwald the clip of Richard Clarke's appearance on ''60 Minutes,'' explaining that it didn't want to be associated with a controversial documentary about Murdoch. WGBH, the Boston PBS station, wouldn't let Greenwald use excerpts from ''Frontline'' for fear of looking too ''political,'' it said.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These copyright owners had the ability to force their copyrighted works to not be included in the documentary. (Not all the clearances were so negative it should be added; Eric Clapton granted the film the right to use ‘Layla’ at no charge as did Don Henley for the track ‘Dirty Laundry.’) Even if Greenwald had left the most contentious and litigious content in the film and relied on the strength of a fair use claim, “as a practical matter the high costs of litigation force most filmmakers to simply remove the material in question.”   Similarly here in Australia, reliance on fair dealing can be risky and the threat of litigation and the costs associated with it often results in filmmakers playing it safe and removing the questionable material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there are some legitimate uses of copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owner, in most instances the right to reuse content will be granted by way of a licence from the copyright owner. Authorisation occurs when the copyright owner (or the “licensor”) grants (or “licences”) permission to another party (or the “licensee”) to exercise any right in the bundle.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;the text of creative commons through the looking glass is available for reuse under the terms of a creative commons attribution 2.5 australia license. for more information see 'legals + licence' at http://ccelliott.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Mike Linksvayer: Requirements for community funding of open source</title>
	<link>http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/11/24/cofundos/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cofundos.org/docs/crowdfunding.php&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cofundos.org/layout/cofundosprocess.png&quot; style=&quot;padding: 5px; float: right;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Last month &lt;a href=&quot;http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/08/27/micropledge/&quot;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; site for aggregating donation pledges to open source software projects &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.aksw.org/2007/open-source-innovation-platform-cofundosorg/&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure there’s anything significant that sets Cofundos apart from microPledge featurewise. Possibly a step where bidders (pledgers) vote on which developer bid to accept. However I’m not certain how a developer is chosen on microPledge — their FAQ &lt;a href=&quot;http://micropledge.com/help/dev#develop&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; “A quote will be chosen that delivers the finished and paid product to the pledgers most quickly based on their current pledging rate (not necessarily the shortest quote).” microPledge’s scheme for &lt;a href=&quot;http://micropledge.com/help/dev#estimate&quot;&gt;in progress payments&lt;/a&gt; may set it apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of marketing and associations, Cofundos comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://aksw.org&quot;&gt;Agile Knowledge Engineering and Semantic Web&lt;/a&gt; research group at the University of Leipzig, producers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBpedia&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;DBpedia&lt;/a&gt;, about which I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/01/23/dbpedia/&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the early proposed projects are directly related to AKSW research. Their &lt;a href=&quot;http://cofundos.org/docs/terms.php#Copyright&quot;&gt;copyright policy&lt;/a&gt; is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;microPledge is produced by &lt;a href=&quot;http://micropledge.com/about&quot;&gt;three Christian siblings&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href=&quot;http://micropledge.com/religion&quot;&gt;don’t push their religion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cofundos lists &lt;a href=&quot;http://cofundos.org/projects.php&quot;&gt;61 proposed projects&lt;/a&gt; after one month, microPledge lists &lt;a href=&quot;http://micropledge.com/tags&quot;&gt;about 160&lt;/a&gt; after about &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.micropledge.com/2007/08/micropledge-public-launch/&quot;&gt;three and a half months&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t see any great successes on either site, but both are young, and perhaps I’m not looking hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cofundos and microPledge are both welcome experiments, though I don’t expect either to become huge. On the other hand, even modest success would set a valuable precedent. In that vein I’ve been pretty &lt;a href=&quot;http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2006/03/18/sxswi-wrap/&quot;&gt;skeptical about the chances of Fundable&lt;/a&gt;, they seem to have attracted a steady stream of users. Although most projects seem to be uninteresting (pledges for bulk purchases, group trips, donations to an individual’s college fund, etc), some production of public goods does seem to being funded, including several film projects in the small thousands of dollars range. Indeed, “My short film” is the default project name in their form for starting a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that creating requirements and getting in front of interested potential donors are the main challenges for sites focused on funding open source software like Cofundos and microPledge (both say they are only starting with software). Requirements are just hard, and there’s little incentive for anyone to visit an aggregator who hasn’t aggregated anything of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if integrating financial donations into project bug tracking systems would address both challenges? Of course doing so would have risks, both of increasing bureaucracy around processing bugs and feature requests, necessity of implementing new features (and bugs) in the relevant bug tracking software, and altering the incentives of volunteer contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>Another interview with &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc.net.au&quot;&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;, this time with me ^_^  Back in April, while I was in Sydney for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourmedia07.net/&quot;&gt;OURMEDIA VI&lt;/a&gt; I ducked into the ABC Ultimo building to record an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pool.org.au/node/894&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; for radio and that would become part of an exciting new ABC-run user-generated content project called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pool.org.au/&quot;&gt;Pool&lt;/a&gt;. More about Pool later, first here's the interview and accompanying video they made:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;(available under a CC &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/au/&quot;&gt;BY-NC 2.5 Aus&lt;/a&gt; licence)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The video gives an overview of CC, the protocols, the commercial/non-commercial distinction and explains possible motivations for wanting to use CC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is Pool? It's a collaborative production environment that people can submit their creative works to. In the about it says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Grow ideas; download, remix and share with your friends and the world. Music, photos, videos, documentaries, interviews, animations, and more. Connect with people; by comments, tags, friend lists, and collaborative co-creation.  Is this the future of public media?&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The site is under a CC &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/au/&quot;&gt;BY-NC-ND 2.5 Aus&lt;/a&gt; licence, but also allows All Rights Reserved and the CC &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/au/&quot;&gt;BY-NC 2.5 Aus&lt;/a&gt; licence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why did they decide to use CC?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We decided to use Creative Commons licences for Pool because we think it's the best way possible to have some fun with content, without breaching any copyright laws.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_version#Beta&quot;&gt;beta testing&lt;/a&gt;, so go easy on it. Get on there and give some good feedback. CCau certainly wants to see it happen!&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;the text of creative commons through the looking glass is available for reuse under the terms of a creative commons attribution 2.5 australia license. for more information see 'legals + licence' at http://ccelliott.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://ccelliott.blogspot.com/2007/11/ccau-staff-talk-lot.html</link>
	<content:encoded>The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au&quot;&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/rn&quot;&gt;Radio National&lt;/a&gt; recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/lawreport/stories/2007/2095456.htm&quot;&gt;broadcast&lt;/a&gt; a mashup of content stimulated by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mwf.com.au&quot;&gt;Melbourne Writers' Festival&lt;/a&gt; debate &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mwf.com.au/2007/content/events.asp?name=20070826_1130_350WS&quot;&gt;Creative commons or common theft?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; recordings that had &lt;a href=&quot;http://craphound.com/&quot;&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://craphound.com/stories.php&quot;&gt;sci-fi author&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/2006/11/30/cory-doctorow-copyright-tech-media_cz_cd_books06_1201doctorow.html&quot;&gt;CC advocate&lt;/a&gt;) in the blue corner and Sandy Grant (Senior executive &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hardiegrant.com.au/&quot;&gt;Hardie Grant Publishing&lt;/a&gt;, and member of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.com.au/&quot;&gt;Copyright Agency Limited&lt;/a&gt; Board) in the red corner. holding the sweat towels were Mark Williams (Senior adviser with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jdrlegal.com.au/&quot;&gt;JDR Legal&lt;/a&gt;) and CCau's very own Jessica Coates (Project Manager, &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org.au/node/74&quot;&gt;Creative Commons Clinic&lt;/a&gt;). You can listen to the recording &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/lawreport/stories/2007/2095456.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great to see CC being talked about (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bookshow/stories/2007/2039471.htm&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;) on the Australian public broadcaster. But as always, I have a few gripes. Damien Carrick opens the podcast by saying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This morning, Creative Commons: making films, literature or music  for free online. It undermines copyright but is it also creating whole new business models and income streams for our artists?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't like it. I know Jess tells me that it's to make it sound controversial to keep people listening, but its misinformation and i dont like it. Sorry Damien, Creative Commons does &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; undermine copyright, it remixes it to create more flexible (and arguably useful) ways of managing copyright. As such, I don't agree that CC &quot;essentially strip copyright of all meaning,&quot; but rather breaths new life and meaning into copyright (as I have said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anat.org.au/stillopen/blog/2007/08/31/copy-me-pass-it-on/&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;). As &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://support.creativecommons.org/videos#gc&quot;&gt;Get Creative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; states, &quot;CC isn't meant to compete with copyright, but to compliment it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on, Williams opened the debate with a tale of one of the first pirated works. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergus_Hume&quot;&gt;Fergus Hume&lt;/a&gt;'s detective (self-published) novel, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Mystery of the Hansom Cab&lt;/span&gt; (first published 1886, you can find it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org&quot;&gt;Project Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4223&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), was pirated and sold throughout Europe. It paved the way for a new genre of fiction (think &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes&quot;&gt;Sherlock Holmes)&lt;/a&gt;. Williams goes on to note that the pirated version went on to sell a huge number of copies, most of the money from which did not find its way into Hume's bank account. So no money there, but as Williams himself attests, &quot;[Hume] was famous, and it enabled him to then write another 100 or so novels...&quot; The problem for most artists, according to Doctorow, is obscurity not piracy. Therefore piracy = reputation (?) Without the piracy, would Hume have had the opportunity to write as much as he did?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Grant gets amongst it. I love that Grant refers to CC as having &quot;something of a cult following.&quot; Gee, &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5579&quot;&gt;53 million pages licensed&lt;/a&gt; and projects in &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/international/&quot;&gt;66 countries&lt;/a&gt; around the world with licences or in the process of drafting them. (Doctorow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.locusmag.com/Features/2007/11/cory-doctorow-creative-commons.html&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; 160 million+ works licensed since 2003, but i am not sure where he is getting that figure from. Cory?) That's a really big cult! Maybe we should try to get Creative Commons added to the recognised religions at the next &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.census.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/d3310114.nsf/Home/census&quot;&gt;ABS Census&lt;/a&gt;?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;SIDE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Grant highlights my comments about Doctorow as a case study. Doctorow's his prior net identity and fame made it far easier for him to push his novel out than other, totally unknown writers will. CC facilitated the distribution and reuse from a copyright management point of view for sure, but it was Doctorow's charisma that propelled it forward. This is the same argument I make as to why the user-specifies-value &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Rainbows&quot;&gt;Radiohead album &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;In Rainbows&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt;worked for them but it is doubtful it would for an emerging band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant later says he doubts that if Doctorow get's as famous as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jkrowling.com/&quot;&gt;J K Rowling&lt;/a&gt; that \ he would still be giving his books away for free. Well Doctorow isn't that famous yet, but he is still quite famous (more so than both Grant and I anyway :p). And how many books is that under CC now Cory? Oh that's right, &lt;a href=&quot;http://craphound.com/stories.php&quot;&gt;five&lt;/a&gt;, all CC licensed. According to Doctorow,&quot;[His] books have outsold [his] publisher's expectations&quot; and the sales of colleagues of similar skill and career status. He also says that there isn't a single writer (that he knows anyway) &quot;Who has tried this and hasn't done it again.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Cory's comment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I think that Ms Rowling would be well advised to try it. Is there anyone here who really believes that no one would have picked up Harry Potter and the Sequel of Great Profitability if they'd gotten a free electronic copy. That what was driving people to the store at midnight in costume was the fact that they couldn't lay hands on a digital copy. Indeed, there was a digital copy, 24 hours before that book hit the stands. The $20 million spent on secrecy for that book was not only ineffective at secrecy, but as best understood as a marketing effort.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;END SIDE NOTE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CC is also a dog's breakfast to Grant, who says, there's &quot;Really good, quality material, of course like Cory's, sitting along side and mixed up with amateur, unreadable crap.&quot; He then proceeds to tout &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewkeen.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Andrew Keen&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Cult-Amateur-Internet-Killing-Culture/dp/0385520808&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Cult of the Amateur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rhetoric, which basically says we're becoming more stupid because anyone can post stuff online. Pffft, elitist wank if ever i heard it. So much for new technologies democratising information production. Not if these guys had the final word. I prefer the Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson's theory in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robinsloan.com/epic/&quot;&gt;EPIC 2014&lt;/a&gt; which will see individuals filtering content and managing their information intake (which is of course already happening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The podcast also tackles the quashing of creative innovation that happens in a permissions culture. in my forthcoming documentary paper there is an entire section devoted to this syndrome but you can read a bit on it &lt;a href=&quot;http://ccelliott.blogspot.com/2007/08/some-thoughts-from-cc-documentary-paper.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, Doctorow also takes a freedom of expression argument, saying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The fact is that the purpose of copyright is promote the diversity of expression. It's not to pick the best works and ensure they're produced. The last thing any of us want our governments doing is deciding what's good and what's bad and then crafting law to ensure that only the good things get produced. Before copyright we had patronage–you could paint a painting if the Pope said so, you could make a ceiling up if the Duke said so, you could make a sculpture if the King said so–that produced the occasional nice fresco but it was a poor way to manage diversity of expression in a liberal society. The purpose of copyright was to change the arbitures of expression to the marketplace. And that's been a reasonably good diversifier of who gets to speak and under what circumstances, but the internet turns out to be an even better one.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on the flip side, Grant says that he's worried that Doctorow's 'papal frescos' are not reality, but rather that democratisation of voices is &quot;encouraging mass graffiti.&quot; After all, &quot;that's what's happening on the internet.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Equally amusing is Grant's recommendation that we all read the Australian Copyright Council's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.org.au/pdf/acc/infosheets_pdf/g094.htm&quot;&gt;fact sheet&lt;/a&gt; on CC. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;SIDE NOTE:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The fact sheet is factually incorrect in parts and is now out of date!&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;END SIDE NOTE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Grant's five word summary, &quot;Don't sign up too quickly.&quot; I'd make the same argument about publishing contracts, record deals, film production contracts, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.optapra.net/&quot;&gt;APRA&lt;/a&gt; and other royalty collecting arrangements. What are you really giving up and for how long when you enter these relationships? Why didn't you talk about that Grant?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He proceeds to bring up the same arguments always spouted around the irrevocability of CC licences. My response is still the same. If I went out on the street in front of my house right now, and I handed to the first 100 people who passed me a poem I had written, I can hardly come back in a week, a month or 20 years time and demand those 20 people give me back my poem. I'd just look like a madman ranting and raving to no one. Even more accurately, if i went out on the street in front of my house and left 100 copies of that poem on the fence for anyone to take and then went back in side, there is no way i could feasibly demand the poems back post-fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, you run the &quot;risk of being exploited by business professionals,&quot; Grant also cautions. He cites the pending &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7680&quot;&gt;Virgin case&lt;/a&gt; as evidence. Grant's synopsis:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Plenty of egg on the face for the photographer, no income, and Virgin got something for nothing.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all the photographers were so up in arms at this use of their work, why is only one suing? And not for copyright infringement I might add, which is the part that CC is related to. What is of issue is the need for a model release form. And hey, if the great unwashed amateurs on &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/groups/central/discuss/72157600541608353/#comment72157600542022693&quot;&gt;tell&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/groups/central/discuss/72157600541608353/#comment72157600611463291&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) that a CC attribution licence doesn't imply a release form was signed , they why the hell did Virgin's lawyers? The licence clearly states otherwise (see 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Grant then continues on, hypothetically asking himself if copyright will remain unchanged. &quot;No,&quot; he answers. And will people still be paying for things they really want? He says yes. I say it depends. The 'apple + c' syndrome makes it easy to get content at a reasonable enough quality to be contented. And as Doctorow says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...it is wildly implausable that as the year's tick by in this century it is going to get progressively harder to copy. Say what you will about the morals of downloading work, the real politic of downloading work is that it's already practically impossible to exclude someone from a collection of bits, and that impossibility will only increase as the year's tick by.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is only if the user's (emotional/cultural) investment in that content is deeper than a general interest that they will turn that into economic investment and buy the same thing. Besides, sampling work can lead to sales. As Doctorow says, &quot;It's a really rare, bookish person who would say, &quot;Well having been given all these all these free electronic texts, the last thing i need now is a printed work,&quot; after all, even I, who spends every hour god sends reading off a screen, don't like reading long-form works off of screen.&quot; He argues that self-discipline drives people off-screen (you've probably already been distracted three times by a new item in your RSS reader, a new email in your Inbox, a quick check of your fav social networking website and countless messages on an IM program), but I think it is more than that. It is hard to be comfortable in front of your computer to watch a feature film or a read a 200 page book. He argues that of the e-books he has, they are more of an enticement to pull down the real-world copy than a substitute for the bookshelf volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CC explanation is very good.

Supporters of creative commons licenses say the pendulum has swung too far towards protectionism, and that this is affecting our creative culture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I missed in unfortunately.

	<title>Joi Ito: Life and death on the Tokyo metro</title>
	<link>http://joi.ito.com/archives/2007/11/21/life_and_death_on_the_tokyo_metro.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/1465289559/&quot; title=&quot;Shibuya Toyoko Line by Joi, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1088/1465289559_9e3257d8bf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shibuya Toyoko Line&quot; height=&quot;336&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
I ended the work day with a study group and an expert guest where we discussed the Japanese legal system. Although there were some small signs of hope, I find that the more I learn about how things really work, the more pessimistic I get about causing actual change in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I pondered the futility of revolutionary activities in Japan, I jogged to try to catch the train to connect to the commuter train for my 1.5 hr shlep back to my home. As I entered the station, I noticed an unusually large crowd of people on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PA system announced a delay due to an accident. Japan has over 30,000 suicides a year (one of the highest rates in the world) and 800 or so of them as a result of “train accidents”. As I crammed myself into the standing-room-only train full of drunken businessmen, tired “office ladies” and shriveled old people, I thought about what kind of person might have jumped in front of the train this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we approached the station where the accident occurred, the train came to a stop and the conductor apologized again for the delay. They shut down the motors as we waited and the everyone was silent and still. As I looked around at the tired people with their blank looks, it felt like we were all involuntarily mourning the death of another person in Japanese society who had to give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at at my home train station, Mizuka was there to pick me up. I shared my depressing thoughts and she scolded me for being so down. When we got home, our dog Pookie yapped away and almost blew these thoughts away, but I decided to share them with you anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Mike Linksvayer: Semantic Web Web Web</title>
	<link>http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/11/21/semantic-www/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;World Wide Web Consortium&lt;/a&gt; and particularly its &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;Semantic Web&lt;/a&gt; efforts do great, valuable work. I have one massive complaint, particularly about the latter: they ignore the Web at their peril. Yes, it’s true, as far as I can tell (but mind that I’m &lt;a href=&quot;http://benlog.com/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://yergler.net/blog/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; steps removed from actually working on the problems), that the W3C and Semantic Web activities do not appreciate the importance of nor dedicate appropriate resources to the Web. Not just the theoretical Web of URIs, but the Web that billions of people use and see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reminded of this by Ian Davis’ post &lt;a href=&quot;http://iandavis.com/blog/2007/11/is-the-semantic-web-destined-to-be-a-shadow&quot;&gt;Is the Semantic Web Destined to be a Shadow?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My belief is that trust must be considered far earlier and that it largely comes from usage and the wisdom of the crowds, not from technology. Trust is a social problem and the best solution is one that involves people making informed judgements on the metadata they encounter. To make an effective evaluation they need to have the ability to view and explore metadata with as few barriers as possible. In practice this means that the web of data needs to be as accessible and visible as the web of documents is today and it needs to interweave transparently. A separate, dry, web of data is unlikely to attract meaningful attention, whereas one that is a full part of the visible and interactive web that the majority of the population enjoys is far more likely to undergo scrutiny and analysis. This means that HTML and RDF need to be much more connected than many people expect. In fact I think that the two should never be separate and it’s not enough that you can publish RDF documents, you need to publish visible, browseable and &lt;em&gt;engaging&lt;/em&gt; RDF that is meaningful to people. Tabular views are a weak substitute for a rich, readable description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Joi Ito: Enjin01 in Niigata</title>
	<link>http://joi.ito.com/archives/2007/11/20/enjin01_in_niigata.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/2038022354/&quot; title=&quot;Dancers in Niigata by Joi, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2116/2038022354_d8d547c761.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dancers in Niigata&quot; height=&quot;336&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Got back yesterday from the Enjin01 event in Niigata. The theme of this year’s event was laughter. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/sets/72157603209481395/&quot;&gt;Flickr set here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.enjin01.org/index2.html&quot;&gt;Enjin01&lt;/a&gt; is a Japanese non-profit that I helped start. It is a funny mishmash of people including artists, business people, politicians, academics, journalists, novelists… just about every kind of background you can imagine. It is a membership organization with about 180 people. It is a totally volunteer organization and no one gets paid for talks we give or activities we participate in and it is funded by membership fees from the members and corporate donations. Some members give a percentage of their normal lecture fees to the organization as well. I was involved in the selection of members and setting up the organization a lot at the beginning, but am mostly just a member now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the activities that we do is go teach at Jr. High Schools that want us to go. Any Jr. High School can sign up for us to dispatch teachers on our websie. &lt;a href=&quot;http://joi.ito.com/archives/2007/10/31/enjin01_talk_to_jr_high_school_students_in_yamagata.html&quot;&gt;I blogged about this earlier.&lt;/a&gt; We also have a group that focuses on trying to change government policy, especially in the area of taxation of donations to non-profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main activity of Enjin01 is to organize an annual meeting in a different region of Japan each year. Most of the members attend this annual meeting. The meeting is organized into a few plenary talks, a bunch of workshops and panels, and a “yagaku” where we go to dinner with people from the local community. We also usually have a closed meeting where the members meet an invited guest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program committee assigns the participant members to various panels and different “yagaku”. This year, I was assigned to a panel about IT, which is par for the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also assigned to be on a panel at a workshop lead by &lt;a href=&quot;http://koichi-inakoshi.com/&quot;&gt;Koichi Inakoshi&lt;/a&gt; to learn about and actually participate in photographing a nude model. I had never photographed a nude model before so I was quite nervous at the beginning. Mr. Inakoshi started by explaining that we should think about the beauty of the model and imagine looking at our own bodies while we are bathing. He told us to try to imagine and see the beauty of the human body. After showing us some of his nude images, he told us to try taking photographs ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience was also invite to participate. The audience probably consisted of 50% women and maybe 50% of them over 40 years old. The panel, which I was on, chose a number of winning photos. One of the women who won a prizes was wearing a kimono. I wish I had a photo of the woman in a kimono photographing a nude model. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One side-effect of this session was that I ended up with some nude photographs. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/tags/nude/&quot;&gt;I posted them in Flickr flagged&lt;/a&gt; as “Moderate” and “Hide this photo from public searches”. I still got a few people telling me that they were surprised and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/2041342791/&quot;&gt;a thread started&lt;/a&gt; on one of my photos about nudes and sensitivity about nude images. After reading a bunch of posts about nude vs naked, I realized this is an old and deep discussion online. The collapsed context of the Internet forces us to deal with these cultural differences in a very real way. With nudes, I find that even in the same society, there is a very wide range of sensitivity levels. One curious thing is why people turn “safe mode” off when they don’t want to see nudes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/2038950080/&quot; title=&quot;Charles Robert Jenkins by Joi, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2160/2038950080_3c0d7008d4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Charles Robert Jenkins&quot; height=&quot;337&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The special guest for the closed member meeting this year was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Robert_Jenkins&quot;&gt;Charles Robert Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;, the former US Army soldier who lived in North Korea for 39 years. He gave us a very candid and real account of his time in North Korea and while some of the facts and assertions were interesting and shocking, his personal account of his day-to-day life in North Korea left the strongest impression. He now lives in Niigata, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “yagaku” can be hit or miss, but this year it was a lot of fun. The deal with the “yagaku” is that we choose a dozen or so local restaurants and several members are assigned to each venue. Then all of the local people are invited to join us to dinner where we are the hosts. We learn a lot about the local culture and they get to spend “quality time” with us. This year, I sat with a number of women who had worked in Tokyo at companies like Fujitsu and Intel but returned to Niigata after getting married. We talked about how to use the net to “stay in the loop”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/2041436373/&quot; title=&quot;Ken Mogi by Joi, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2360/2041436373_265685f5f7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ken Mogi&quot; height=&quot;336&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
One of the highlights of the event was getting to hear &lt;a href=&quot;http://qualiajournal.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Ken Mogi&lt;/a&gt; speak and having time to chat with him a bit. In addition to being one of the most brilliant people I know, it turns out that he has a very funny and rich personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year, we will be holding the event in Nagoya. Anyone is welcome to join us.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Lawrence Lessig: Tom Bell on &quot;Intellectual Privilege&quot;</title>
	<link>http://lessig.org/blog/2007/11/tom_bell_on_intellectual_privi.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomwbell.com/&quot;&gt;Tom Bell&lt;/a&gt; is writing a book about (what's called) &quot;intellectual property&quot; in public. He calls it &quot;intellectual privilege.&quot; &lt;blockquote&gt;I here offer a third view of copyright. I largely agree with my friends on the left that copyright represents not so much a form of property as it does a policy device designed to &quot;promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts&quot; (as the Constitution puts it). I thus call copyright a form of intellectual privilege.

Like my friends on the right, however, I hold our common law rights in very high regard. Hence my complaint against copyright: it violates the rights we would otherwise enjoy at common law to peaceably enjoy the free use our throats, pens, and presses. That is not to say that copyright is per se unjustified. We can excuse facial violations of our common law rights, such as the takings effectuated by taxation or the restraints imposed by antitrust law, as the costs of obtaining a greater good. But it does mean that copyright qualifies, at best, as a necessary evil.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Watch and participate at his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intellectualprivilege.com/book.html&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://ccelliott.blogspot.com/2007/11/cc-planet-cc-people.html</link>
	<content:encoded>i was thinking the other day about how great it is that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org&quot;&gt;cc international&lt;/a&gt; homepage now feeds from the other &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/international/&quot;&gt;jurisdictions&lt;/a&gt; webpages. i had long thought that would have been a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but when i tried to work out what the feed address was so i could subscribe to it in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.utsire.com/shrook/&quot;&gt;rss reader&lt;/a&gt; i couldn't find it anywhere! i even spent some time searching the page code and came up with nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i'm pretty slack, so i hadn't gotten around to now, cc international has conveniently created &lt;a href=&quot;http://planet.creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;cc planet&lt;/a&gt;, which does just that. you can either go to the website or subscribe to the feed to keep up with what all the cc jurisdictions are up to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;interestingly they've also decided to include the individual blogs of people who work for creative commons, both within the planet list and as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://planet.creativecommons.org/people/&quot;&gt;separate page&lt;/a&gt; of just the cc people. well actually, cc planet incorporates three different pages: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://planet.creativecommons.org/jurisdictions/&quot;&gt;jurisdictions page&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://planet.creativecommons.org/people/&quot;&gt;cc people page&lt;/a&gt; and the international site, jurisdictions and &lt;a href=&quot;http://planet.creativecommons.org/people/&quot;&gt;cc people&lt;/a&gt; altogether in &lt;a href=&quot;http://planet.creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;one feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and they have included little old me (on this blog) ^_^&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;the text of creative commons through the looking glass is available for reuse under the terms of a creative commons attribution 2.5 australia license. for more information see 'legals + licence' at http://ccelliott.blogspot.com&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;No puedo dejar pasar &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boingboing.net/2007/11/16/indie-film-producer.html&quot;&gt;este post de Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt; en boing-boing acá va traducido (boing-boing tiene una licencia CC BYNC genérica):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eric D. Wilkinson, productor de la película independiente “Jerome Bixby’s The Man From Earth,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rlslog.net/piracy-isnt-that-bad-and-they-know-it/&quot;&gt;escribió una carta al editor de Releaselog&lt;/a&gt;, un sitio que hace referencias filtrando películas disponibles en las redes P2P. No escribió para quejarse, anoten– el escribió para mencionar el valor promocional que le ha generado la piratería de su película, y cómo esto se está viendo reflejado en ventas reales para él.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Estoy enviando este email después de darme cuenta de que nuestro sitio ha obtenido cerca de 23,000 hits en los últimos 12 días, muchos de ellos provenientes de su website. Adicionalmente, nuestro trailer, tanto en el sitio www.manfromearth.com como en otros tales como YouTube, MySpace y AOL ha sido visto cerca de 20,000 veces Y lo que es más impresionante es que nuestro ranking en IMDb pasó del puesto 11,235 de los más populares, al de la 5a película más popular en 2 semanas (somos además la película independiente #1 en IMDb y la #1 de ciencia ficción en IMDb). Cómo sucedió esto? unas palabras: Torrent / Sitios para compartir archivos”. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

	<title>Carolina Botero: Semana de noticias desde el Software Libre</title>
	<link>http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/?p=293</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pensé que esta semana que pasó iba a ser terriblemente ocupada… y no me equivocaba aunque tuve que bajarle mucho el ritmo pues como ya muchos saben aunque soy muy vieja para meter la pata… lo hice!! estoy enyesada y eso significó yeso e incapacidad… Sin embargo, logré arrastrame y pasar ratos en un par de eventos que estaban sucediendo en Bogotá: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agenciadenoticias.unal.edu.co/articulos/universidad/universidad_20071113_revista.htm&quot;&gt;“Jornada de gestión y difusión de revistas académicas vía Internet”&lt;/a&gt;. Dos personas, Juan Pablo Alperin y Gustvao Fischman, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pkp.sfu.ca/&quot;&gt;del proyecto PKP&lt;/a&gt; presentaron el software libre OJS que vienen desarrollando para gestionar y publicar revistas en Internet. Este es un Interesante software que apoya la publicación de revistas y privilegia el formato para hacerlo en Acceso Abierto aunque (como todo Software Libre) no obliga a ello, es decir, puede usarse en el esquema que se desee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Además de lo que ellos presentaron también mostraron las experiencias de Universidad de la Sabana, Universidad Javeriana y Universidad Nacional usándolo. Me impresionaron los datos de la revista de psicología de la Javeriana, pero admito que me encantó la presentación de la Universidad Nacional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La revista de “Acta Agronómica” de la Nacional se hace desde Palmira y lo presentó la bibliotecóloga de la sede con mucha propiedad. Mostró como sin conocimiento técnico la tecnología se pone al alcance. Me encantó como empezó su charla indicando que ella había encontrado que la revista de su sede tenía un valor muy importante para la biblioteca, un valor que casi nunca se le reconocía a las revistas en ese campo: “moneda de canje”, pues a través de ella la biblioteca recibe 575 revistas de 60 países diferentes, lo que es un importante patrimonio en su oficio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En ninguna de las presentaciones se hizo mención al derecho de autor (los conferencistas de PKP lo hicieron para indicar que era una elección de cada una de las revistas), la único alusión fue por la conferencista de la Universidad de la Sabana que con el título de “Retención de Derecho de autor” indicó que “los autores pueden colocar sus artículos en la web y difundir los artículos a otros científicos”… ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En términos generales los participantes no distinguían entre acceso público o gratuito y acceso abierto, supongo que es normal, en esto hay todavia mucho camino para recorrer, pero, definitivamente todos salieron entusiasmados y yo también.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dinero.com/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?IdArt=41346&quot;&gt;“Primer congreso de software libre, desarrollo tecnológico y sector solidario”&lt;/a&gt;. Si bien no pude acudir todo lo que me hubiera gustado, de lo que asistí fue interesante ver a la gente hablando de software libre para no inicidados y, sobre todo, viendo como se va moviendo el lado de “negocios” en este campo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Una importante delegación española trajo desde Extremadura un montón de ganas y uno que otro &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrMUMT9OhZI&quot;&gt;video interesante&lt;/a&gt; que pareció la respuesta a la intervención de la Ministra de Comunicaciones que según supe hizo recordar a todos la propaganda de Davivienda: “estaba en el lugar equivocado”. De Brasil nos contaron como el gobierno ha desarrollado una licencia especial “publica” que se utiliza en el software que desarrolla el estado, y también me hablaron de lo que presentaron otros participantes de Venezuela, Argentina y los colombianos, pero confieso que me quede con las ganas de haber asistido más, será hasta la próxima vez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actualización: La apuesta de Dan Social, organizador del segundo evento, por el SL espero que rinda sus frutos! de hecho ya lo mencionan &lt;a href=&quot;http://elpais.com.co/paisonline/notas/Noviembre202007/eco02.html&quot;&gt;en EL PAIS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Lawrence Lessig: The weird world of &quot;indecency&quot;</title>
	<link>http://lessig.org/blog/2007/11/the_weird_world_of_indecency_1.html</link>
	<content:encoded>So as readers of this site know, I represent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robertgreenwald.org/&quot;&gt;Robert Greenwald&lt;/a&gt; (pro bono) in a some fair use matters. My first work was on his film &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outfoxed.org/&quot;&gt;Outfoxed&lt;/a&gt;. Robert has been continuing the campaign against Fox. His latest is a very clever set of attacks on the &quot;indecency&quot; of Fox News. (The purpose is to push the FCC to unbundle cable channels). Watch the video below and you'll see the point. 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Ok, so here is where things get weird. All of this content is content broadcast on Fox television. All of it thus passes the censors at the FCC. Yet &lt;strike&gt;stories about Robert's latest are now &lt;a href=&quot;http://foxnewsporn.com/banned.php&quot;&gt;banned on DIGG&lt;/a&gt;. And&lt;/strike&gt; YouTube requires you verify you're over 18 to see the clip. (At 9pm, the story is &lt;a href=&quot;http://reddit.com/toplinks&quot;&gt;#1 on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand.)

So it's ok to broadcast this content to kids for the purpose of driving ratings and ad revenue, but banned for purposes of criticizing the (yet again) hypocritical Fox network. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newshounds.us/2007/11/15/alert_digg_bans_video_seen_on_fox_news_and_youtube_labels_it_18.php&quot;&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; abound here. My guess is that some pro-free speech entities (&lt;strike&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://DIGG.com&quot;&gt;DIGG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strike&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://YouTube.com&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;) are just not thinking. 

&lt;b&gt;UPDATE&lt;/b&gt;: DIGG did the right thing. Read (and digg) &lt;a href=&quot;http://digg.com/offbeat_news/Digg:_foxnewsporn.com_Unbanned_&quot;&gt;Kevin's correction&lt;/a&gt; of their mistake. Bravo.</content:encoded>

	<title>Carolina Botero: Usos de Creative Commons en Colombia</title>
	<link>http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/?p=292</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Una de las satisfacciones de explicar, exponer y dedicar parte del día (de todos los días) a estos temas de las licencias abiertas es encontrar gente que las usa y que crea proyectos interesantes donde las licencias son eje central. En días pasados me escribieron un email en el que cuentan un proyecto muy interesante que prefiero que ellos mismos cuente. Reproduzco entonces, con el debido permiso, el email en cuestión:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Este mail no tiene otro objetivo que contarte sobre un proyecto documental que se desarrolla bajo licencia Creative Commons, en el que estamos involucrados varias personas por acá en la ciudad de Medellín (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/federicoruiz&quot;&gt;Federico Ruiz &lt;/a&gt;“astronautaperdido”, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/pe5pe&quot;&gt;Luis Pérez “pe5pe”&lt;/a&gt; y yo Francisco Cárdenas “cinealoido”). La base somos nosotros, pero hay otro grupo de buenos amigos entre ellos los chicos de  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lacapsula.com/&quot;&gt;La Cápsula&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La idea con este proyecto es hacer un un documental sobre lo que hoy en día sabemos de Juan David Posada Arango “rifas”, un personaje que le apuesta al rebusque callejero como oportunidad de vida. Rifas es reconocido en el sector del parque del Poblado por hacer rifas de cerveza, trago, comida, por dos mil pesos el puesto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es un personaje que representa la fortaleza del típico rebuscador callejero, y que mediante una propuesta creativa, logra calar mensajes en la gente que le escucha y participa de su oficio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El proyecto lleva algo así como dos meses largos, estamos en etapa de preproducción, y estamos documentándonos como es debido. Llevamos &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cinealoido.com/rifas/&quot;&gt;una bitácora &lt;/a&gt;con cada una de las cosas en las que vamos avanzando (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cinealoido.com/rifas/acerca/&quot;&gt;Aquí&lt;/a&gt; una justificación - presentación del proyecto). Hemos colgado los videos de cada una de las charlas, Se han publicado&lt;br /&gt;
igualmente los archivos de audio de cada sesión y en Flickr están algunas de las fotos de cada encuentro con el personaje. Los archivos están en crudo, no tienen ningún tipo de edición, y se cuelgan en la red para poder acceder a ellos desde cualquier lado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El cronograma dice que debe haber producción en la segunda semana de diciembre y que si todo va bien, en marzo saldrá al aire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ya contamos con el apoyo de los Coffee Makers, Ciudad Pasarela, Kafeina y  Los Arboles en la parte musical, estamos pendientes de Lucrecia, y de otros dos músicos de la ciudad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bueno Caro, no era sino para eso, contarte de ésto, cualquier sugerencia con gusto la recibimos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ya en su debido momento estaremos dando la difusión necesaria para que ésto se pueda regar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacho&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

San Francisco, CA — November 14, 2007&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoy Creative Commons lanzó un Add-in para OpenOffice.org que permite a los usuarios selecciona e incluir una licencia Creative Commons en los documentos. Basado en el trabajo que se completó como parte en el Google Summer of Code por Cassio Melo, el add-in soporta Writer (editor de texto), Calc (hoja de cálculo) e Impress (presentaciones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Google Summer of Code provee fondos a estudiantes para trabajar en el desarrollo de softwaer de código abierto en los meses de mayo a agosto. Durante el verano de 2007, Cassio trabajó desarrollando el addin básico para OpenOffice.org. Nathan Yergler, Jefe de Tecnología de Creative Commons, sirvió de tutor para Cassio apoyado generosamente por los programas de Código Abierto de Google. “Cassio aportó importantes bases para que nosotros construyeramos sobre ellas y las mantuviéramos. Estoy encantado de poder ofrecer finalmente apoyo para OpenOffice.org” dijo Yergler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Add-in esta disponible sin cargo, y está licenciado con GNU General Public License. Información para la descarga y enlaces al código fuente se pueden encontrar en &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OpenOfficeOrg_Addin&quot;&gt;http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OpenOfficeOrg_Addin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;

	<title>Lawrence Lessig: ccMixter - thinking about where to go</title>
	<link>http://lessig.org/blog/2007/11/ccmixter_thinking_about_where.html</link>
	<content:encoded>Some of you have seen the fantastic site we built at CC called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ccmixter.org/&quot;&gt;ccMixter&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; Launched after &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/wired&quot;&gt;Wired released a CD which invited people to remix CC licensed music&lt;/a&gt;, ccMixter has built a community of remix artists. Thousands of tracks within a system that tracks who remixed what. So, e.g., the technology enables you to say &quot;this track was made by remixing these three tracks, and it has been remixed by these four other tracks.&quot; Making transparent the community that is remix, on a platform of CC licensed content. 

We launched ccMixter as a demonstration project. As with all our demonstrations, we expected eventually it would spin out to something self-sustaining. How and whether we do that with ccMixter is now something we're beginning to consider. We've asked the ccMixter community about their thoughts about a change. (You can read the missive I sent to them last night in the Extended Entry below). But I wanted to state here some important framing values about this that will not change.

We are considering this change because we want ccMixter to flourish. We could likely continue to support it as it is. It's not cheap, but it isn't terribly expensive. We've been very lucky to have a brilliant musician and  technologist (Victor Stone) incubate the project. I'm sure we could persuade him to continue.

But if the ccMixter community is really to flourish, it needs support beyond the support a nonprofit can provide. So we're considering how we might permit that support to be secured. 

Here are the principles that will guide this change:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;CC will not profit off of CC artists: We're not an agency; we will set up no arrangement where the success of CC artists translates into financial success for CC. We're happy to receive gifts from our community; we're not about to receive commissions. We are therefore keen to restructure ccMixter so that any commercial benefit flowing to CC artists won't seem an indirect benefit to CC.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ccMixter will never lose its current commerce-free face. It will always be &quot;free&quot; in both the costless and free-speech sense. It will never have ads. It will always be a .org. The community that exists there now can continue just as it exists now. No one will have to make any change to how they contribute to the ccMixter community, if no change is what they want.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any change in ccMixter will be completely transparent, and only with the support of its community. The transparent part of this is simple. The support of the community part is complicated by fiduciary obligations imposed upon a non-profit like CC. But we will work hard to make sure that we do only what the community believes (properly interpreted of course) makes sense. Our ultimate aim here is to enable more for that community. We achieve that aim by understanding it.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All the software and creative work will always remain &quot;free&quot;: First, the (&lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6026&quot;&gt;award winning&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcHost&quot;&gt;code is free&lt;/a&gt; (licensed under the GPL); we will contribute the copyrights to that code to the GNU Project as soon as we can convince RMS of the capabilities of the maintainer. Second, the music is free (all licensed under terms that permit at least noncommercial sharing and remix). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I'm sure there will be more that I add to this list as we work through this. But I'd welcome other comments in the comment section to this post. We've not done something like this before. We need lots of eyeballs to make sure we do it right. 
      Here's the letter I wrote to the members of the ccMixter community: &lt;blockquote&gt;Hello,

I am writing to ask for your advice about a Creative
Commons project that you know a great deal about:
ccMixter. Let me start by saying &quot;thank you&quot; for
participating in that project. By sharing your gifts
with the community so that other musicians can learn
and create together, you have helped us make it clear
that culture is enriched when artists work together in
a legal and sane way.

As you know, ccMixter.org started as a tie-in
promotional remix contest with WIRED magazine . Thanks
to you, it has grown into a vibrant community of
quality musicians sharing not only their love for
music but the music itself, and not just with each
other but with everybody through Creative Commons
licensing. As part of a larger initiative to spread
the word about music in the Commons, that one-off
remix contest site is now part of the larger Creative
Commons Sample Pool that boasts over 50,000 CC
licensed music samples including 700 amazing a
cappellas. As sponsors of ccMixter.org and the Sample
Pool initiative we are both honored and heartened that
the music production community has taken to these
projects.

We at Creative Commons are now working through how we
can best build upon the success that ccMixter is. We
are a nonprofit. We don’t have the resources or
expertise to turn it into a business. Nor do we want
ccMixter to lose its special commons-like character.
We are therefore considering a move that I’d like to
get your feedback about. 

This move would change the &quot;ownership&quot; of ccMixter,
and add to its potential. It would not in any way
change its importantly &quot;free&quot; character. In reading
the description that follows, please keep this promise
in clear view: ccMixter’s core character — as a free,
non-advertising space where people can share and remix
(at least for noncommercial purposes), will not change.
Instead, the change we are considering would simply
complement this core character, with added
functionality, and value, that we believe could help
sustain the site, and make it much more significant.

It is this change that I want to get your feedback
about. The plan currently being discussed is to
identify a competent commercial entity to take over
operations of ccMixter. Subject — again — to the
requirement that they keep the existing ccMixter.org
site as it is, this commercial entity would be free to
add commercial services beyond the services currently
provided. Again (and I know, even if I say this 100
times, there will still be some who don’t hear it),
ccMixter.org would remain as it is. It would be kept
free from any commercial interference (fees, ads,
etc.) and continue to have all the music owned by you,
licensed under CC; in other words, everything exactly
the way it is. But the company would fund the free
site by creating a new business-to-business website
devoted to serving commercial consumers of music. 

This new site (call it ccMixter-Plus) will be for
commercial purposes and require that the artist signs
a (non-exclusive) contract with the company to
participate. By signing with the company, the artist
will allow the company to license music for the
financial gain of both the company and the artist.
Registered users of the free ccMixter site will be NOT
automatically be signed to the business site, That
decision will be between the artist, company and
fellow artists. No one will be required to sign. No
one’s rights to use ccMixter.org will change depending
upon whether they sign. The only change would be to
offer to artists who want it a way that they might
commercialize some of their (and everyone who wants)
creativity. And its aim would be to enable this
opportunity with minimal hassle. 

So, again, ccMixter (the free site) would continue to
work the same way it always has. But it would now also
serve as a &quot;community A&amp;amp;R&quot; pool for signing artists to
ccMixter-Plus (the music licensing site). The profits
from the business, in turn, would fund the free site,
and guarantee it can continue to grow as one of the
most interesting music remix sites on the web.

How would the company be selected? As a nonprofit, we
have no choice but to auction the right to run
ccMixter-Plus to the most appropriate bidder. That’s
not necessarily the highest bidder, but the obligation
of our board must be to promote the objectives of
Creative Commons. We know that Victor Stone is eager
to participate in this new organization. Our board
member, John Buckman, founder of Magnatune, and member
of the board at EFF, may also be interested in funding
the organization. But the auction to determine the new
owner would be open to all. No insider can or will have
any special access or advantage. 

So that’s the plan we’re exploring. But as I said at
the start, we won’t do anything without the support of
our community. You have made ccMixter. So I am asking
you to give us feedback about this plan. If the
feedback is strongly negative, we’ll try to find
another way to help ccMixter grow. But I am hopeful
that the response will be strongly positive. We
launched ccMixter to demonstrate an idea. You’ve
turned that idea into an extraordinary reality. I am
keen to find an effective way for that reality to
grow. Please let me know if the idea I’ve sketched
here is a way that you could support.

If you click on the following link, it will take you
to a place where we’re collecting feedback.

Thanks again for your help.

	<title>Lawrence Lessig: 4Barack</title>
	<link>http://lessig.org/blog/2007/11/4barack.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barackobama.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.barackobama.com/images/widgets/Obama08_ThumbLogo200.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Barack Obama Logo&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&quot;DON'T DO THIS!&quot; a friend wrote, a friend who never uses allcaps, a friend who cares genuinely about what's good for me, and who believes that what's good for me depends in part upon how easily I can talk to the next administration. &quot;He is NOT going to win. She has it sewed up. DON'T burn your bridges before they're hatched -- so to speak.&quot; 

So was my suggestion that I come clean publicly about what many here will have intuited long ago -- tha I support Barack Obama for President -- met by my friend. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://lessig.org/blog/2004/03/barack_breaks_the_20_rule.html&quot;&gt;I said as much in March, 2004&lt;/a&gt;, though I expected this year would be four years later. Barack was a colleague from way back. I've supported every campaign since the first. And from the very first moments I knew the guy, I thought that he was precisely the sort we should be able to elect as President. 

Friendship, however, isn't the most compelling reason (for at least others) to support a candidate for President. I was therefore relieved and very happy that on substance, too, this is my candidate. 

The closest leading competitor for my loyalty is of course Edwards. He's got great views about technology and privacy. He's got a fantastic commitment to changes that might well address the corruption that has become my focus. And he's come around to the right views about the war. I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://lessig.org/blog/2003/03/edwards_in_person.html&quot;&gt;long admired his passion and conviction&lt;/a&gt;. And but for fears about his flirting with protectionism, he would, in my view, make a great President.

The other front running Democrat, however, is not a close call for me. (Saying this is what terrified my newly allcaps friend.) She supported the war, but as my support of Edwards last time round indicates, I can forgive that. The parts I can't get over all relate to the issues around corruption. I signaled as much in &lt;a href=&quot;http://lessig.org/blog/2007/08/on_clinton_and_lobbyists.html&quot;&gt;my comments about her comments about lobbyists&lt;/a&gt;. We see two radically different worlds here. And were she President, I'd bet everything that we'd see radically little change.

But the part that gets me the most about Senator Clinton is the eager embrace of spinelessness. I don't get this in Democrats generally. I never have, but I especially don't get it after two defeats to the likes of George Bush (ok, one defeat, but let's put that aside for the moment). Our party seems constitutionally wedded to the idea that you wage a campaign with tiny speech. Say as little as possible. Be as uncontroversial as you can. Embrace the chameleon as the mascot. Fear only that someone would clearly understand what you believe. (Think of Kerry denying he supported gay marriage -- and recognize that the same sort of people who thought that would win him support are now inside the control room at ClintonHQ).

All politicians of course do this to some degree. And about some issues, I even get it. But what put me over the line with Senator Clinton was the refusal to join the bipartisan &lt;a href=&quot;http://lessig.org/blog/2007/04/a_call_on_the_rnc_dnc_to_elimi.html&quot;&gt;call that presidential debates be free&lt;/a&gt;. Not because this is a big issue. But because even on this (relatively) small issue, she couldn't muster the strength to do the right thing.

Her failure here was not because her campaign didn't know of the issue. I spoke directly to leading figures (or so they said) in the campaign. The issue was discussed, and a decision was made. And the decision was to say nothing about the issue. You can almost see the kind of tiny speak that was battered around inside HQ. &quot;Calling for free debates might be seen as opposing copyright.&quot; &quot;It might weaken our support among IP lawyers and Hollywood.&quot; &quot;What would Disney think?&quot; Better to say nothing about the issue. Better to let it simply go away. 

And no doubt that was the safe bet, highly likely and politically sensible. But the issue of course didn't go away. The legal threats that motivated us to launch this call for free debates materialized in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lessig.org/blog/2007/10/free_debates_foxs_fair_use_fig.html&quot;&gt;a threat against Senator McCain&lt;/a&gt;. But that again gave the Senator an opportunity to say something true and principled and consistent with values she certainly ought to hold dear: That Fox should not not silence McCain, even if his words were an attack on her. Again, there was an opportunity for principled, and strong character. Again, it was frittered away by tiny speak among the very same sorts who frittered away 2000, and 2004. 

We (Democrats) and we (Americans) have had enough of this kind of &quot;leadership.&quot; That (plus the Lincoln Bedroom) made it impossible for me, honestly, to support Senator Clinton. No doubt I would prefer her to any Republican (save, of course, the amazing Ron Paul). But I can't support the idea that she represents the ideals of what the Democratic Party must become.

And that leaves Barack -- an easy choice for me (except for the &quot;trailing Clinton&quot; part) for lots of reasons. 

First, and again, I know him, which means I know something of his character. &quot;He is the real deal&quot; has become my favorite new phrase. Everything about him, personally, is what you would dream a candidate should be. Integrity, brilliance, warmth, humor and most importantly, commitment. They all say they're all this. But for me, this part is easy, because about this one at least, I know.

Second, I believe in the policies. Clearly on the big issues -- the war and corruption. Obama has made his career fighting both. But also on the issues closest to me. As the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lessig.org/blog/Fact%20Sheet%20Innovation%20and%20Technology%20Plan%20FINAL.pdf&quot;&gt;technology document&lt;/a&gt; released today reveals, to anyone who reads it closely, Obama has  committed himself to important and importantly balanced positions.

First the importantly balanced: You'll read he's a supporter of Net Neutrality. No surprise there. But read carefully what Net Neutrality for Obama is. There's no blanket ban on offering better service; the ban is on contracts that offer different terms to different providers for that better service. And there's no promise to police what's under the technical hood (beyond the commitment already articulated by Chairman Powell): This is a sensible and valuable Net Neutrality policy that shows a team keen to get it right -- which includes making it enforceable in an efficient way, even if not as radical as some possible friends would like.

Second, on the important: As you'll read, Obama has committed himself to a technology policy for government that could radically change how government works. The small part of that is simple efficiency -- the appointment with broad power of a CTO for the government, making the insanely backwards technology systems of government actually work. 

But the big part of this is a commitment to making data about the government (as well as government data) publicly available in standard machine readable formats. The promise isn't just the naive promise that government websites will work better and reveal more. It is the really powerful promise to feed the data necessary for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://Sunlightfoundation.com&quot;&gt;Sunlights&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://Maplight.org&quot;&gt;Maplights&lt;/a&gt; of the world to make government work better. Atomize (or RSS-ify) government data (votes, contributions, Members of Congress's calendars) and you enable the rest of us to make clear the economy of influence that is Washington.

After the debacle that is the last 7 years, the duty is upon the Democrats to be something different. I've been wildly critical of their sameness (remember &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lessig.org/blog/2006/12/dems_to_the_net_go_to_hell.html&quot;&gt;Dems to the Net: Go to hell&lt;/a&gt;&quot; which earned me lots of friends in the Democratic party). I would give my left arm to be able to celebrate their difference. This man, Mr. Obama, would be that difference. He has as much support as I can give.

(Oh, and to my allcaps friend, this was my reply: &quot;Don't be ridiculous. This isn't about misplaced courage. Barack is going to win this one easily.&quot;)</content:encoded>

An important advance in the life of the network happened today. Miro 1.0 was released. Think about the history of computing technology -- from the bottom of the stack up, the movement has been from proprietary to free. The hardware became a commodity, then the OS, then many apps. Miro represents the commodifying the content protocol layer. &quot;It's a platform that benefits everyone by keeping online video open,&quot; the website promises. Here's my promise: it signals the movement of those seeking proprietary profits further up the stack. That's always a  thing for innovation and growth.</content:encoded>

	<title>Joi Ito: Three years with ICANN</title>
	<link>http://joi.ito.com/archives/2007/11/12/three_years_with_icann.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/1807861462/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2337/1807861462_2d39fbeb55.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Darth Vader, Stormtroopers come to ICANN meeting&quot; height=&quot;336&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What used to think ICANN was like...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the delay in writing the post. I've been trying to think about what to say and have just decided that I better write it before my thoughts get old...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined the ICANN board during the December 2004 ICANN meeting in Cape Town. I served for a three year term and stepped down at this last meeting in Los Angeles and didn't run for another term. My apologies to all of the ICANN community and the people who helped me learn about and participate in the complex but important process that is ICANN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before joining ICANN, I thought that ICANN was the only part of the Internet that wasn't really working. I knew that there must be a better way to do what ICANN does, but I couldn't be bothered to figure it out. I'd agree with people who said things like, &quot;it should just be distributed&quot; or &quot;it should just be first come first serve&quot; or &quot;we should just get rid of it.&quot; People from ICANN would say, &quot;it's more complicated than that&quot; or &quot;at this point that would be impossible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being part of the process for three years, I find myself saying those same things and feeling a sense of exasperation at the people who take pot shots at ICANN from the peanut gallery without really trying to help or change things. I also have gained a huge respect for most of the people who participate in ICANN, many as volunteers, trying to improve the process and keep the Internet running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of it's tumultuous history and bumps and warts, ICANN, in my opinion, is the best way that we can manage names and numbers on the Internet and any new thing to try to do what it does would be less fair and probably wouldn't work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some technical architectures and ideas that might make ICANN less relevant, which would be a good thing. However, even relatively obvious things like IPv6, IDNs and DNSEC are having a hard time getting traction. I think that it would be nearly impossible to &quot;redesign the DNS&quot; and get people to use it. It would be like trying to redesign a flying airplane. On the other hand, their might be some evolutionary changes that make domain names less relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICANN process as it is currently working involves a number of supporting organizations that feed into a consensus and policy development process. The board is 15 people, 8 who are &quot;neutral&quot; and nominated from the public through the nomcom process and 7 who are elected from the supporting organizations. It is geographically and otherwise fairly well distributed and balanced. It is nearly impossible to &quot;capture&quot; the process. If any stakeholder wants to participate, they just have to show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem that ICANN has is not one of being unfair, the problem that ICANN has is the difficulty and time required in trying to reach consensus on difficult issues. The other problem is that most of the people who are affected by the decisions, the average users, don't know or care about ICANN. Trying to figure out an better way to get their input has always been an issue, but is one that is not unique for ICANN. All of politics and collective action share the difficulty in getting the public to care about issues that affect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was urged by a number of people to join the board, I thought of my term on the board as a kind of &quot;jury duty&quot;. I had been benefiting from the Internet running properly for the last decade, building businesses and my social network on the Internet. I felt that three years would be a kind of &quot;community service&quot; to give back some of what I had received. The board work included nearly monthly conference calls, probably several thousand pages of reading, two face-to-face board retreats and three meetings per year. The meetings are a week long. This adds up to nearly two months or more of work a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the new chairman of Creative Commons and my portfolio of companies requiring more and more of my time, I just couldn't justify serving another term. I calculated that I spent more time reading about and discussion whether we should allow .xxx than I spent on any one portfolio company this year... and at the end of it, I voted in the minority and .xxx was shot down and I ended up as just a voting statistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I have no regrets. I met amazing people, learned a lot about how the Internet works and have gained a great respect for the people and the organizations that make up and contribute to ICANN. Many thanks to the ICANN staff, board and various constituents who have made my term a fruitful and exciting one.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Lawrence Lessig: The Terror Presidency: Hard questions for all of us</title>
	<link>http://lessig.org/blog/2007/11/the_terror_presidency_hard_que.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lessig.org/blog/51JcTnuG8QL._SS500_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;51JcTnuG8QL._SS500_.jpg&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/facdir.php?id=559&quot;&gt;Jack Goldsmith&lt;/a&gt; is a friend from law school. We clerked together at the Supreme Court. We have remained friends since. When he went to the Justice Department to head the Office of Legal Counsel (read: the coolest possible job in the world of public lawyers), many of us were anxious. The kind of legal storm that was/is the Bush Administration is not a place one wishes on friends.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Terror-Presidency-Judgment-Inside-Administration/dp/0393065502&quot;&gt;The Terror Presidency&lt;/a&gt; is the story of Jack's time at OLC. It is a book that makes me very proud -- of the ideals of my profession, and of my friend. You've no doubt heard the sexy bits -- orchestrating the reversal of OLC on the torture memos, the scene at the hospital with Ashcroft, etc. Those alone make the book worth the read. Indeed, the new attorney general said he &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Woj-4WFUeEc&amp;amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Etpmmuckraker%2Ecom%2F&quot;&gt;couldn't put it down&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;

But the two parts that grabbed me were these: 

(1) The hardest part of this story for those of us who believe in executive oversight (and believe that the Constitution means what it says in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#A1Sec8&quot;&gt;Article I, Section 8, Clause 18&lt;/a&gt;) is the extraordinary account of the costs of legalizing (as in subjecting to law) much of the work of the CIA and Defense Department. Long after this administration is gone, careful souls will need to understand how to overcome the debilitating costs of this sort of legal uncertainty. The simple answers (repeal the law; expand the regulation) are too simple. But Jack's account interestingly flipped my understanding of the struggle inside the administration. It is hard not to see that the problem was often not a lack of law, or respect for the law, but an over-abundance of law. (We) Liberals, happy to have clear and plain speaking from an inside-conservative, should not be so quick to overlook this critical point of the book.

(2) There is something unavoidably fantastic about watching up close law have its independent effect. Most go into this profession believing in its integrity. Many find it too hard too often to see or feel that integrity. This is a book about that integrity. As anyone close to this subject knows, it is always possible to bend the law to some political end. It takes a kind of courage, or at least, self-respect, to resist that bending. Jack's story here is compelling, not only because he doesn't attribute the bending to illicit motives, but also because it makes clear just how hard it is to feel the ground on which one needs, always, to stand. If our students understood only a fraction of this, it would make enormous difference.

I am proud of this friend.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;En enero de 2006 una persona abre un blog en Internet y utiliza como propios los contenidos de otro blog, esta situación comienza a discutirse dentro de la blogosfera colombiana y &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/?p=40&quot;&gt;pone a los bloggers a pensar en derecho de autor y en licencias Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;, los pone a pensar sobre la idea central que era el deseo de todos de compartir contenidos con normas claras de referencia y reconocimiento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esta preocupación se mantiene a pesar de que &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/?p=260&quot;&gt;Creative Commons tiene hoy amplio reconocimiento&lt;/a&gt; no es claro para muchos como funciona y por qué.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I landed in Beijing yesterday at 5AM from Los Angeles and am leaving today at 1PM for New York. From a logistical and environmental perspective, I think this was one of my stupider trips. However, from a content perspective, this was one of my best trips ever. I really met more interesting people, saw more interesting things and had more interesting conversations in a single day than I’ve had in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out the morning yesterday by giving at talk at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cnbloggercon.org/2007/&quot;&gt;cnbloggercon&lt;/a&gt; organized by Isaac Mao. I gave a talk about the sharing economy and got some interesting questions and hallway conversation about sharing in the context of China. I also got to meet a lot of the Chinese bloggers I only knew by name. Many thank for Isaac and his crew for organizing this excellent annual conference and sorry I haven’t made it over before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cn.creativecommons.org/en/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons China&lt;/a&gt; Photo Content ceremony at the National Library in Beijing. There were 10,000 submissions of professional and amateur works licensed under various CC licenses. There were three categories: Society, Nature and Portraits. Winners were chosen by a panel of judges including famous photographers, professors and other notable people. The photographs were amazing. There is &lt;a href=&quot;http://cc.nphoto.net/contest2007/winners.html&quot;&gt;a web page of the winning photographs&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t forget to click the link underneath the winning photos for the second place winner gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we have silly people in the West saying that for every free photo on Flickr a professional photographer loses their job, we have professional photographers in China licensing their best works under CC licenses. As far as I could tell, the amateur and professional photographers seemed integrated and supportive of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the awards ceremony, we have a workshop with presentations from an illustrious and interesting group of speakers. Overall a groundbreaking and well executed event. Congratulations Chunyan and the CC China team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/sets/72157602918061297/&quot;&gt;I’m uploading photos from my trip in a Flickr set.&lt;/a&gt; I found out yesterday that there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4286&quot;&gt;a Firefox Plugin to bypass the Chinese block on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Vint stepped down as chairman of ICANN as his term came to and end. The new board elected Peter Dengate Thrush as the new chairman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My term also came to and end. I'll blog about this more, but thought I should post this first...&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Joi Ito: 24/7 DIY Video Summit</title>
	<link>http://joi.ito.com/archives/2007/11/01/247_diy_video_summit.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;24/7 DIY Video Summit is a conference which involves more of my friends than just about any conference recently. It should be a blast. Be there or be square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.video24-7.org&quot;&gt;24/7: A DIY VIDEO SUMMIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February 8-10, 2008 School of Cinematic Arts, University of Southern California&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Howard says] I’m thrilled to moderate a session on Feb 9 that will include Yochai Benkler, John Seely Brown, Joi Ito, Henry Jenkins, and Lawrence Lessig. I don’t think this particular group has ever been on stage together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conference web site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.video24-7.org&quot;&gt;http://www.video24-7.org&lt;/a&gt; 
Blog: &lt;a href=&quot;http://diy.video24-7.org/&quot;&gt;http://diy.video24-7.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaces are limited for attendance at the academic panels and the workshops. The video screenings are free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24/7: A DIY Video Summit will bring together the many communities that have evolved around do-it-yourself (DIY) video:artists, audiences, technology providers, academics, policy makers and industry executives. The aim is to discover common ground, and to chart the path to a future in which grassroots and mainstream, amateur and professional, artist and audience can all benefit as the medium continues to evolve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This three-day summit features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCREENINGS OF DIY VIDEO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 8 and 9, there will be screenings of DIY video that are
open to the public. These will feature curated programs on design video, activist documentary, youth media, machinima, music video,  political remix and video blogging. The video program will culminate in an evening program and reception on February 9 that will draw from all of these video genres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACADEMIC PROGRAM &lt;br /&gt;
Registered attendees will have access to the academic program on February 8 and 9 that features panels on The State of Research, The State of the Art, DIY Media: The Intellectual Property Dilemma andDIY Tools and Platforms. Featured speakers include Yochai Benkler,
John Seely Brown, Joi Ito, Henry Jenkins, Lawrence Lessig, and Howard 
Rheingold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WORKSHOPS AND BIRDS-OF-A-FEATHER MEETINGS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 10, the day will be devoted to practical and hands-onworkshops for registered attendees on topics such as intellectual property, media creation, distribution and new-media design tools. 
Attendees will also have the option of organizing their own birds-of-a-feather meetings to connect with other attendees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Mike Linksvayer: Peer producing think tank transparency</title>
	<link>http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/10/31/think-tank-peer/</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mercatus.org/Publications/pubID.4397/pub_detail.asp&quot;&gt;Hack, Mash &amp;amp; Peer: Crowdsourcing Government Transparency&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercatus_Center&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;Mercatus Center&lt;/a&gt; looks like a reasonable exhortation for the U.S. jurisdiction government to publish data in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_format&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;open formats&lt;/a&gt; so that government activities may be more easily scrutinized. The paper’s first paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government makes an overwhelming amount of data publicly available each year. Laws ranging from the Administrative Procedure Act to the Paperwork Reduction Act require these disclosures in the name of transparency and accountability. However, the data are often only nominally publicly available. First, this is the case because it is not available online or even in electronic format. Second, the data that can be found online is often not available in an easily accessible or searchable format. If government information was made public online and in standard open formats, the online masses could be leveraged to help ensure the transparency and accountability that is the reason for making information public in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s great. But if peer produced (a more general and less &lt;a href=&quot;http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2007/03/10/wiki-commercial/&quot;&gt;inflammatory term than crowdsourced&lt;/a&gt;; I recommend it) scrutiny of government is great, why not of think tanks? Let’s rewrite that paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think tanks produce an overwhelming number of analyses and policy recommendations each year. It is in the interest of the public and the think thanks that these recommendations be of high quality. However, the the data and methodology used to produce these positions are often not publicly available. First, this is the case because the data is not available online or even in electronic format. Second, the analysis that can be found online is often not available in an easily accessible or searchable format. Third, nearly everything published by think tanks is copyrighted. If think tank data and analysis was made public online in standard open formats and under open licenses, the online masses could be leveraged to help ensure the quality and public benefit of the policy recommendations that are the think tanks’ reason for existing in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think tanks should &lt;strong&gt;lead by example&lt;/strong&gt;, and improve their product to boot. Note the third point above: unlike &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_status_of_work_by_the_U.S._government&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;U.S. government produced works&lt;/a&gt;, the output of think tanks (and everyone else) is restricted by copyright. So think tanks need to take an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;extra step&lt;/a&gt; to ensure openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Actually think tanks only need to lead in their domain of political economy — by following the trails blazed by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;Open Access&lt;/a&gt; movement in scientific publishing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only the beginning of leading by example for think tanks. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midasoracle.org/2006/12/13/libertarian-baiting/&quot;&gt;When has a pro-market think tank ever subjected its policy recommendations to market evaluation?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reason.com/blog/show/123276.html&quot;&gt;Via Reason.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Joi Ito: Enjin01 talk to Jr. High School students in Yamagata</title>
	<link>http://joi.ito.com/archives/2007/10/31/enjin01_talk_to_jr_high_school_students_in_yamagata.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/1745319108/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2413/1745319108_8d28857578.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nagai Minami Jr. High School students&quot; height=&quot;336&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Students of Nagai Minami Jr. High School&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I helped start a non-profit organization in Japan called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.enjin01.org/index2.html&quot;&gt;Enjin01&lt;/a&gt;. The leader of the organization is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeaki_Saegusa&quot;&gt;Shigeaki Saegusa&lt;/a&gt;, a sometimes crazy, but a very giving, thoughtful and inspired person. He collected a number of notable people and called out to a diverse group of &quot;cultural figures&quot; including company executives, writers, architects, actresses, educators, academics, artists, political figures and musicians. The group is now about 100+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have annual meetings where we visit a region of Japan and work closely with the local community to produce a volunteer, free-of-charge event open to the public that includes workshops and talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the annual event, we recently started a program where any Jr. High School can fill out a form on the site and request Enjin01 to dispatch a number of us to teach at the school. So far we haven't turned any requests done and have done quite a few I understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I participated for the first time. Four of us went to Nagai Minami Jr. High School in a small town in Yamagata. The Shinkansen (bullet train) stopped about 20 min away so it was fairly convenient, but still took me over three hours from home one-way. However, the travel wasn't the hard part...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I am on the board of Nishimachi International School which has a Jr. High, I had never really had to stand in front of a Jr. High School class and teach. They had scheduled two classes of 35 or so students each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was probably one of the hardest talks I've ever given. I had forgotten what it was like to be in Jr. High and also realized that Jr. High in Yamagata was probably quite different from Nishimachi. I tried very hard to connect to the students, but the combination of their shyness and my lack of context made it very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, it was a great experience. A few of the students were visibly excited and the &quot;wrap up&quot; session where all of the students and teachers got back together and reported back showed that at least the kid who reported back was listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think that speaking to Jr. High School students who really don't know or much care about your real-world importance/fame is good for the soul and refreshing. I recommend it to people who are mostly speaking at industry conferences to the same crowds. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my hearty thanks to our hosts in Yamagata and I hope it was worth it for all of you too.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Joi Ito: Otetsudai Networks</title>
	<link>http://joi.ito.com/archives/2007/10/21/otetsudai_networks.html</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;linlineimage&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://joi.ito.com/R0010040.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://joi.ito.com/R0010040-tm.jpg&quot; hspace=&quot;4&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; vspace=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;R0010040&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Screen showing all of the people&lt;br /&gt;available to work on a map.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Last week I met Mr. Sunagawa from LocationValue Inc. that runs Otetsudai Networks. Otetsudai Networks is a very cool service that is one of these &quot;perfect for Japan&quot; things.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the advanced aging population and the tendency for many of the younger generation to not be in a hurry to lock down full-time jobs, businesses are having an increasingly more difficult time filling posts - so much so that some businesses are having to close down, not because of lack of business, but purely because they can't staff their stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister has written about the Japanese youth behavior where less and less stuff is planned - the kids going out and using their mobile devices to meet up or deciding to do things while constantly keeping in touch with each other. These swarming bands of kids are now adults and many of them don't want to be tied down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These &quot;kids&quot; are not becoming adults. In a recent survey by Otetsudai Networks, most people surveyed cared more about freedom and flexibility than the pay when considering a part-time job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter Otetsudai Networks. With Otetsudai Networks, if you are willing to work, you sign up for the service with your skills and focus, take a GPS reading on your phone and then just hang out. If you are looking for someone for say... 3 hours to man a cash register or help wash dishes, you just send the request to Otetsudai Networks and within minutes, you have a list of people available. The list shows what each person is qualified for, how others have rated their work and exactly how far away they are. Typically you will receive a list of half a dozen or more people within a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The businesses are rated too on a per-manager basis so when you're hanging out with your friends and you get a request to go help at the corner convenience shop, you know how your peers have rated that particular guy who's asking you to come and help. You can also counter the request and say you'd go if they paid you 2000 yen / hour instead of 1500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more and more people start using this system, it's liable to start filling a very important gap in the workforce. It's also a perfect example of a location based, peer-to-peer reputation based, mobile behavior oriented product for an aging society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website is &lt;strike&gt;otetsu.jp&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://otet.jp/&quot;&gt;otet.jp&lt;/a&gt;, but most of the functionality is only available on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update from Mr. Sunagawa:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. The English name of the company is LocationValue Inc.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Employer will see only the name of applicants rather than all the&lt;br /&gt;
available people around.  &quot;...you have a list of people available&quot; may sound&lt;br /&gt;
inaccurate.&lt;br /&gt;
3. primary URL of our web is otet.jp instead of otetsu.jp although otetsu.jp&lt;br /&gt;
would also be redirected to our site.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE 2: They have about 45,000 users with 1,000 new users per week.&lt;/p&gt;
