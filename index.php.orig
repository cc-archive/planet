<div class="content" lang="en">
<p><a href="http://buckyjonson">Bucky Jonson</a> is the name of the band that drives the funky soul behind the multi-platinum Grammy winning band the <strong>Black Eyed Peas</strong>. The band is actually made up of Printz Board, George Pajon Jr., Tim Izo and Keith Harris. A few months ago they stepped out from the shadows with their oh-so-appropriately named solo album “<a href="http://bbemusic.com/data.pl?release=BBEMP3083">The Band Behind the Front…</a>.”
</p><p>Now for the real news: The album’s individual solo tracks along with many outtakes have been made available with a BY-NC license at <a href="http://ccmixter.org/buckyjonson">ccMixter.org/buckyjonson</a>.
</p><p>Bucky represents some of the best soul/funk virtuoso musicians on the scene today so it’s no surprise that these recording are the cleanest, best originally performed samples ever put into the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5784">Creative Commons Sample Pool</a> (which is approaching the 50,000 sample count). There was so much material delivered from the band it took a <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/thread/1247">small army of volunteers</a> from the ccMixter community to chop the tracks into bite-size remix-able loops. Over 205 MB of un-cut tracks and the loops are available for <a href="http://ccmixter.org/buckyjonson">free download here</a>.
</p><p>The release of these tracks is part of an ongoing <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/2007/09/creative-commons-and-bbe-music-collaborate-on-release-of-remixable-dj-vadim-tracks/">relationship between CC and BBE Music</a> that includes the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/djvadim">DJ Vadim remix contest</a> and subsequent <a href="http://ccmixter.org/bbe">release of Vadmin’s album into the Commons</a>. The winners of that contest were put onto the “<a href="http://www.bbemusic.com/data.pl?release=BBECD082">Soundcatchers Extras</a>” album along side Vadim and other members of the worldwide consortium of musicians and DJ operating under the banner of the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/0neself">One-self Collective</a>.
</p><p>The best remixes posted to ccMixter of Bucky and Vadim continue to be culled for other One-self projects including live dates around the world, soundtracks for videos and playing them on the BBE radio shows in London and Spain.</p></div>

<h4 class="meta">
<a href="http://creativecommons.org" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a>, October 29, 2007 07:48 PM </h4>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p><a href="http://www.thetraceyfragments.com/"><em>The Tracey Fragments</em></a>, the latest film from Canadian director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_McDonald">Bruce McDonald</a>, follows the story of a 15-year-old girl (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680983/">Ellen Page</a>) who has “lost her little brother and sets out on a desperate journey to find him”. While the film itself <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0jEN2_REy4">looks absolutely phenomenal</a>, <em>Tracey: Re-Fragmented</em>, the film’s online counterpart, is where the project really begins to take shape for those in the CC-community. From The Tracey Fragments: 
</p><blockquote><p>Tracey: Re-Fragmented makes available at www.traceyfragments.com all the footage from the shoot of the film for users to download and re-edit their own related projects including music videos, new trailers or to re-edit the entire movie themselves. The <strong>Creative Commons licensed initiative</strong> also makes available the score of the movie by Indie Collective Broken Social Scene. 
</p><p>Director Bruce McDonald explains the inspiration behind the project: “The Tracey Fragments is a film that fully embraces experimentation and teamwork.  I wanted to find out if that experience exists on the Internet and give others the chance to experiment and play with some beautifully shot footage of a world class actress in a free form environment. I hope people make their own feature films, short films, rock videos, trailers, experimental films and personal manifestos out of The Tracey Fragments.” </p></blockquote>
<p>McDonald’s decision to embrace CC-licensing for <em>The Tracey Fragments</em> is remarkable in both practice and scope. Fans can choose to do what they will with the massive amount of assets provided ( under the terms of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">BY-NC-SA licence</a>), interpreting and re-envisioning the the film and its subject material in what is bound to be a variety of ways. By putting the film’s assets in the hands of would-be-editors and film-makers under CC-licences, <em>Tracey: Re-Fragmented</em> recognizes and embraces the concept of a hybrid economy, allowing people to experiment freely with the content around them while retaining the film’s commercial interests.
</p><p><em>The Tracey Fragments</em> already represents a fascinating foray into unique narrative and filmic techniques (specifically multi-frame editing) and <em>Tracey: Re-Fragmented</em> continues that experimental nature into the realm of content licensing. It should be noted that <em>Re-Fragmented</em> also functions as a contest in which the winner will receive a Tracey/Final Cut prize package, the details of which can be found at the “Re-Fragmented” section at the <a href="http://www.thetraceyfragments.com/">“Tracey website</a>. <em>The Tracey Fragments</em> has its US premier at the AFI Film Festival in Los Angeles on Nov. 6th at 6:45. You can find other select screening times at the <a href="http://thetraceyfragments.blogspot.com/"><em>Tracey Fragments</em> blog</a>.</p></div>

<h4 class="meta">
<a href="http://creativecommons.org" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a>, October 29, 2007 05:18 PM </h4>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>To the Commoners community, from Cory Doctorow:
</p><p>My writing career and Creative Commons are inextricably bound together. My first novel, <a href="http://craphound.com/down/">Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</a>, was published by <a href="http://www.tor-forge.com/">Tor</a>, the largest science fiction publisher in the world, on January 9, 2003, just a few days after CC launched its first licenses. I was the first author to use the licenses, applying them to my book and releasing it for free online on the same day it appeared in stores. Today, the book has been through more printings than I can keep track of, been translated into more languages than I know, and has been downloaded more than 750,000 times from my site alone (I don’t know the total number of downloads, because, of course, anyone is free to redistribute it).
</p><p>I’ve applied Creative Commons licenses to all my books since, including the comics that IDW just adapted from six of my short stories. I use CC for my speeches, for my articles and op-eds, and for articles and stories that I write for “straight” magazines from Forbes to Radar. My co-editors and I use CC licenses for our popular blog, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a>, one of the most widely read blogs in the world. These licenses have allowed my work to spread far and wide, into corners of the world I never could have reached. I hear from sailors on battleships, volunteers working in the developing world, kids in underfunded school-districts, and people who “don’t usually read this sort of thing” but found my work because a friend was able to introduce them to it. My readers have made innumerable technical remixes, fan-fic installments, fan-art drawings, songs, translations and other fun and inspiring creative works from mine, each time humbling and inspiring me (and enriching me!).
</p><p>CC turns my books from nouns into verbs. My books *do stuff*, get passed around and recut and remade to suit the needs of each reader, turned to their hand the way that humans always have adapted their tools and stories to fit their circumstances. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_O'Reilly">Tim O’Reilly</a> says, my problem is not piracy, it’s obscurity, and CC licenses turn my books into dandelion seeds, able to blow in the wind and find every crack in every sidewalk, sprouting up in unexpected places. Each seed is a possibility, an opportunity for someone out there to buy a physical copy of the book, to commission work from me, to bring me in for a speech. I once sold a reprint of an article of mine to an editor who saw it in a spam message — the spammer had pasted it into the “word salad” at the bottom of his boner-pill pitch to get past the filters. The editor read the piece, liked it, googled me, and sent me a check.
</p><p>CC lets me be financially successful, but it also lets me attain artistic and ethical success. Ethical in the sense that CC licenses give my readers a legal framework to do what readers have always done in meatspace: pass the works they love back and forth, telling each other stories the way humans do. Artistic because we live in the era of copying, the era when restricting copying is a fool’s errand, and by CC gives me an artistic framework to embrace copying rather than damning it.
</p><p>Writers all over the world are adopting CC licenses, creating an artistic movement that treats copying as a feature, not a bug. As a science fiction writer, this is enormously satisfying: here we have artists who are acting as though they live in the future, not the past. CC is changing the world, making it safe for copying, and just in time, too.</p></div>

But we need your help. We have only a couple of months to do our research, so we need you to help us shape of the course, figure out the format of the case studies, and carry out research. Time is genuinely tight - we must complete all the course materials by the beginning of February, ready for delivery in March.
</p><p>Right now, this week, we need your ideas. What open-IP business models have you come across? And who is experimenting with opening up their IP?</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="title"><a href="http://techblog.creativecommons.org/2007/08/24/a-farewell/">A Farewell</a></h2>
<h4 class="meta">
<a href="http://techblog.creativecommons.org" title="TechBlog">CC Techblog</a>, August 24, 2007 04:45 PM </h4>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>Well, today is my last day.  I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time here at CC.  Thanks to everyone here at the office and elsewhere who I interacted with this summer.  I’ve met a lot of innovative, hardworking folks and they all deserve a big kudos.  While I’ve been here I’ve created liblicense which had been conceived for a while by Jon.  I think its at a point where inclusion into content platforms is now the key.  We’ve done three releases but technically four.  None of this would have been possible without the help of Jason Kivlighn.  Back at the University of Washington (UW) him and I were roommates and will be living in the same house this fall.  Jason is a super coder who finished his own Google Summer of Code project about halfway through the summer.  Instead of just fizzling out he helped me by revamping parts of liblicense and writing modules to support all of the formats we currently support.  I wouldn’t have gotten nearly as far without Jason’s help.  Before I bid farewell and move on, let me recap a bit of what I did.</p>
	<p>Well, my primary project was liblicense.  Basically,  I was handed down the idea of tracking licenses on ‘the desktop’.  I arrived to find tons of UI mockups created by Rebecca for my implementing pleasure. Before I began implementing the UIs I spent the first three or four weeks conceptualizing and implementing the core liblicense library.  The first (and second) release was on July 13.  After this release I began focusing on Gnome desktop integration.  I really enjoyed seeing a frontend to the hardwork I did on the backend.  Hopefully, more will be done.  At the same time as I did the Gnome integration, Jason mirrored my efforts in KDE4.  After the release of the gnome stuff and library changes on July 30, I moved onto Sugar integration.  I’ve since finished the Sugar integration and the files are available here: http://cctools.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cctools/liblicense-sugar/trunk/ .  We’ll probably never officially release it due to its exclusivity to the Sugar interface.  I’m proud of where liblicense has come.  Like I’ve written before, I think that license awareness is important and liblicense is a small, important step in the right direction.</p>
	<p>My other project which I volunteered to help with was the LiveContent liveCD.  When I got here Tim was assigned the task of producing the new Creative Commons LiveCD with a target of LinuxWorld (August 8th) as a release date.  After a week or so here I offered to technically advise the project.  While my intention was to only be a reference I quickly became technically responsible for the CD and its creation.  Although this was not what I had bargained for, it was well worth it.  To create the CD we utilized livecd-creator, a Fedora LiveCD creator.  It was a challenge for me to adapt to a different packaging system (from portage for Gentoo to rpm for Fedora).  Additionally, although livecd-creator is a step in the right direction (like liblicense) it did not fulfill all of  our needs and resulted in some hacky scripts to build the CD.  To counter those frustrations I added an easter egg to the CD which I will not disclose.  <img src="http://techblog.creativecommons.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" class="wp-smiley" />  Having Tim orchestrating the entire project also reduced my stress level quite a bit.  However, it is quite nerve-racking creating a LiveCD to be duplicated 1000 times and pushed by both Creative Commons and Fedora.  All in all, it turned out great.  The next version(s), which I will not be a part of,  should be even better.</p>
	<p>I’m moving on.  While I’ve enjoyed my time here at CC, I’ll not be continuing on these projects.  I’ve got a somewhat short attention span for projects and it has run dry for both LiveContent and liblicense.  Over the last few days I’ve been brain dumping so that Asheesh can pick up where I left off.  This move should be good for the projects because Asheesh is a very smart and driven person.  You should check out his current project jsWidget. Since I’m done,  I’ll be driving home to Washington (the state not the district) tomorrow morning.  When I get there I’ll be enjoying home and working on educational materials for teaching Python in the intro Computer Science course at UW.  After that I plan on focusing on my own projects.</p>
	<p>Lastly, I’d like to thank everyone here at CC.  Alex, our graphic designer, has been a huge help on both liblicense (he wrote the Ruby bindings) and LiveContent ( he did the sweet packaging).  Nathan Yergler’s flexibility allowed me to switch between projects on my own will and thus keep stress to a minimum.  All of the other CC interns, Tim, Rebecca, Cameron and Thierry, made this summer great because we bonded as a group as we worked hard and hung out at various events.  Finally, Jon has been an immense help by entertaining my questions, dealing with my grumpiness and encouraging me on both of my projects.  As always, there are many others who made this a great experience but the folks mentioned are those who I worked with day-to-day.  Thanks, everyone.  I hope that what I started while here at CC sees much use in the future.  Cheers.</p></div>

<h4 class="meta">
<a href="http://techblog.creativecommons.org" title="TechBlog">CC Techblog</a>, August 13, 2007 06:20 PM </h4>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>The tech team here is examining how we can better-organize our web servers and web sites.  If you are a DNS sleuth, you may have noticed that most of our web sites are served from a server called “apps.creativecommons.org.” But there are some problems with this setup: for example, some of our sites are lots of little static files (like the images site, i.creativecommons.org), and some serve CPU-intensive web pages (like wiki.creativecommons.org).  We can handle many, many more requests to i.creativecommons.org per second than to wiki.creativecommons.org.</p>
	<p>In order to prevent Apache from overloading the computer it’s running on, we have to limit the maximum number of web pages it can serve at once.  If a thousand people at once were requesting our images, that would be no problem, but we couldn’t really handle a thousand requests to our wiki at once.  So we have to set the web server to the limit that can be handled by the most difficult site – otherwise, when more people start editing our wiki at once than we can handle, service will degrade really terribly for everyone, even the clients just getting images from i.creativecommons.org!</p>
	<p>We knew the above from experience, but we didn’t really have data on which web sites (“vhosts”) were using up the most server resources. At first I thought I’d turn to Apache’s powerful logging system. I wanted to know how much server time was elapsing between the start of a request and when the server was ready to respond to it. Alas, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</a> only lets you log the total time elapsed from start of request to end of request, which means that large files or users on slow links can distort the picture. A large image file going slowly to a modem user doesn’t actually preclude us from sending another few hundred such files at the same time. On the other hand, if a wiki page is taking 5 seconds before it is ready to be sent to the user, those 5 seconds will be even longer if someone else requests another wiki page. Measuring the time from start of request to the beginning of the response seemed a good (albeit rough) way to measure actual server-side resources needed to respond.</p>
	<p>I did notice that <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_headers.html">mod_headers</a> could send a message to the client telling him exactly what I wanted to record! So I patched Apache to have mod_headers pass its information down to mod_log_config, and then I could log how much time elapsed from request start to</p>
	<p>Every once in a while, but as recently as this past weekend (at <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.org/SuperHappyDevHouse19">Super Happy Dev House</a>, even!), I hear people say, “Open source is great, but it’s not as if anyone actually uses the source to fix problems they encounter.” In this case, software freedom was more than theoretical; it meant the ability to make the software tell us things about itself that helps us better serve the community we exist to serve.</p>
	<p>You all can see (and distribute under the same terms as Apache) the <a href="http://cctools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cctools/log_analysis/vhost_effort/">patch and some quick reporting scripts</a> I slapped together.  Feel free to email me with any questions!</p></div>

<p>We have just implemented <a href="http://wiki.ontoworld.org/index.php/Semantic_MediaWiki">Semantic MediaWiki</a> on our wiki. SMW allows additionnal markup into the wiki-text and improve the overall quality and consistency of the wiki. It may appear to make things more complicated but it actually makes easier for users to find more information. Using SMW’s own inline querying tools, a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Content_Directories#Video">page</a> could then be created that lists almost everything you want.</p>
	<p>When you add contents as for now, please use semantic annotations. We have created special pages for you that will help you to easily do that.<br />
At the moment, you can find instructions for <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Template:Books">Books</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Template:ContentDirectory">Content Curators</a> and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Template:ContentRegistry">Content Registry</a>.<br />

<h2 class="title"><a href="http://techblog.creativecommons.org/2007/08/03/licensing-on-the-gnome-desktop/">Licensing on the Gnome Desktop</a></h2>
<h4 class="meta">
<a href="http://techblog.creativecommons.org" title="TechBlog">CC Techblog</a>, August 03, 2007 09:49 PM </h4>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>A few days ago we released version 0.3 of liblicense.  This version focused on bringing liblicense onto the desktop and improvements to make that a satisfying experience.  The primary things we added to integrate into Gnome were a generic GTK license chooser widget, default license chooser, and nautilus extension.  These things combine to demonstrate the power of licensing on the desktop.  Additionally, we added optional sqlite3 cache support to speed up the <strong>get_licenses</strong>() function primarily.  Here is a run through of the changes.</p>
	<p>The GTK license widget is used extensively throughout the integration.  The widget provides an interface to the license choosing functions in liblicense.  A user selects a license by toggling various attributes.</p>
	<p><img src="http://cc-livecd.dreamhosters.com/ll_default_1.png" align="middle" height="467" alt="GTK Widget in Default Chooser" width="321" /></p>
	<p>This is the default license chooser.  The GTK widget is in the frame above the buttons.  The widget provides <strong>get_license</strong> and <strong>set_license</strong> which in this case is used to set the default license for the system.  Ideally, the default system license would be used by applications when they embed license data upon save.  However, that is ideal and not implemented yet.</p>
	<p>The default license is used in the nautilus extension.  The default license is used in the file properties license tab whenever a file doesn’t have a license set.  The properties tab also utilizes the GTK widget.   Once the user selects a license for the file(s) and closes the dialog the data is written to the files using the liblicense io modules.  These are C modules which embed and extract license data in particular file formats.  Having numerous modules provides decent coverage of file formats.  Currently, if Exempi support is enabled, all files can be handled by creating an XMP sidecar file in the absence of any other means of license storage.  We’ve also considered other means of license association but see embedding as the ideal option.  Here is a screenshot from nautilus.</p>
	<p><img src="http://cc-livecd.dreamhosters.com/ll_nautilus_scaled.png" alt="Nautilus File Properties" /></p>
	<p>The second aspect of the nautilus integration is license loading upon folder open and resulting emblems.  All the extension does is reads the license from every file nautilus loads and tags Creative Common’s licensed files with the CC logo and non-CC licensed works with our license icon.  Here is  a screenshot of the emblems.</p>
	<p><img src="http://cc-livecd.dreamhosters.com/ll_nautilus_emblem_scaled.png" alt="Nautilus CC emblems" /></p>
	<p>Thats about it.  We’d love feedback before our next release (0.4).  On the CC wiki we have a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Liblicense_04_release_todo" title="0.4 release to do">running list of things to do</a>.  You can get liblicense 0.3 from the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80503&amp;package_id=238700" title="liblicense download">cctools download page</a>  The liblicense home is also on the CC wiki available <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/project/Liblicense" title="liblicense project page">here</a>.  Its currently available in source packages, rpms and ebuilds and will be available in debs by the end of today.  Lastly, there is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L91vjVurtkg" title="liblicense Video">video of liblicense in action</a> on youtube.</p></div>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>The scrubbing bubbles have been at work again on JsWidget. JsWidget is an attempt to let web application developers insert the Creative Commons “Choose a license” questions into their application by just including one file from creativecommons.org.</p>
	<p>I just released a new pre-release version of JsWidget, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=529136&amp;group_id=80503">version 0.3</a>. You can read about the project on <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/JsWidget">its wiki page</a>, including learning how to use it.  There are some interesting new features:</p>
	<p>First of all, it’s compatible with Internet Explorer. My generated JavaScript code was suffering from a correctness issue that using XHTML in Firefox showed me, and fixing that made it render in Internet Explorer.  (Then I had to <a href="http://nathan.ashleafmedia.com/2007/onclick-not-onchange/">switch</a> from using onChange to onClick, again a subtle correctness issue.)</p>
	<p>Secondly, it supports a cool form of internationalization called HTTP Content Negotiation. Web browsers optionally (but usually) send a header to the web server indicating the sort of content they can accept, including what languages the user wants to read. In addition to the old ?locale= form of specifying a language, the text should be translated to the user’s native language. (Unfortunately not all of the strings are translated yet, but try hovering over an info box or looking through the list of jurisdictions. In all cases where we don’t have a translation, we fall back to US English.)</p>
	<p>Finally, it supports a feature called “license seeding.” By default, the UI offers the user the Attribution license in the generic jurisdiction. By passing in a URL, you can change that starting point. This is especially useful for letting a user revisit a license choice he made in the past and consider changing it.</p>
	<p>You can read more about these features on the wiki page for this project, and if you’re sly you could even look at your plan for the future. But the most fun thing to do always is to play with our demos!  Now there are three:<br />
</p><ul><br />
<li><a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/jswidget/tags/0.3/example_web_app/">Standard use</a></li><br />
<li><a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/jswidget/tags/0.3/example_web_app/with-seed.html">With “seeding” a license</a></li><br />
<li><a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/jswidget/tags/0.3/example_web_app/with-seed-old-version.html">With “seeding” a license whose version is upgraded</a></li><br />

<p>I’ve been working for the past week or so on a JavaScript licensing widget that has been <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/JsWidget">suggested on our wiki</a>.  It’s a new way to integrate CC licensing into your web application.  It’s really as easy as pie: Just add the following tag somewhere in the body:<br />
</p><blockquote>&lt;script src=”http://api.creativecommons.org/jswidget/tags/0.1/complete.js” /&gt;</blockquote><br />
and a CC licensing widget will appear.  Your web application can then use<br />
regular DOM queries to determine the user’s choice.<p></p>
	<p>NOTE that this is not ready for prime-time use!  I want feedback on what people would like us to add or change.  Right now it serves only English-language text; in the future you will be able to add ?locale=, stick your language code at the end, and get text back in your language.  Beyond translation, tell me how else I can be of service!</p>
	<p>You can download a trivial sample application and a long-ish README at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80503&amp;package_id=239510">our SourceForge project</a>.  For y’all’s convenience here’s a <a href="https://cctools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cctools/jswidget/tags/0.1/example_web_app/README">link to the README</a>.</p>
	<p>It’ll take you all of five minutes to deeply understand what’s going on, so I suggest you do if you’re thinking about (or if you already are) offering CC licensing to users of web applications you work on.</p>
