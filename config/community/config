# WARNING: Ugly hack alert.
# I am hijacking this variable.  Apparently you can't arbitrarily add custom
# variables to the [Planet] section (though you can to a feed).  Since this
# actually is Planet of Planets we need a different title for every Planet, yet
# we use the same template for all of them.  These Planet-level variables are
# made available to the template directly, outside of the Channels and Items
# arrays.  I'm implementing this ugly hack because it seems better than
# implementing some ugly hack on the Planet Venus code itself.  Nathan Kinkade

owner_name = This page aggregates blogs by people or organizations who write about CC topics, including people affiliated with CC or jurisdiction projects.  To be included, a blog must minimally be under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">license</a> and contain all highly relevant posts, or be able to provide a feed of all highly relevant posts (e.g. a category feed).  Contact webmaster@creativecommons.org if you know of a blog that should be included here. Opinions are those of individual bloggers.

# NOTE ON CATEGORY FILTERING
#
# Not every blog supports creating category-based feeds.  So we have the
# ability to filter based on category ourselves.  A small plugin/filter has
# been created that will do this called filter_categories.py.  You can apply
# the filter on a blog by blog basis by adding the following two lines to any
# blog section in this file:
#
# filters = filter_categories.py
# filter_categories = Creative Commons, cc, creative_commons
#
# No quotes.  Spaces are okay.  Just a comma separated list of category names.
