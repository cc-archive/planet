# WARNING: Ugly hack alert.
# I am hijacking this variable.  Apparently you can't arbitrarily add custom
# variables to the [Planet] section (though you can to a feed).  Since this
# actually is Planet of Planets we need a different title for every Planet, yet
# we use the same template for all of them.  These Planet-level variables are
# made available to the template directly, outside of the Channels and Items
# arrays.  I'm implementing this ugly hack because it seems better than
# implementing some ugly hack on the Planet Venus code itself.  Nathan Kinkade
